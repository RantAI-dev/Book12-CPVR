<em>Part 3 of CPVR delves into the core principles and techniques of computational mechanics, illustrating how Rust's capabilities enhance the accuracy and efficiency of physical simulations. It begins with numerical methods for solving Newtonian mechanics, laying the groundwork for understanding the motion of bodies under forces. The focus then shifts to simulating rigid body dynamics, highlighting algorithms for predicting and analyzing the behavior of solid objects. The section further explores Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), addressing the complexities of fluid flow simulations and the challenges of resolving various scales and phenomena. It continues with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for structural mechanics, discussing methods for analyzing stress and strain in materials and structures. The final chapter covers Continuum Mechanics Simulations, applying computational techniques to model and analyze the continuous behavior of materials under different conditions. This part emphasizes Rust's role in implementing efficient, reliable, and scalable solutions for complex mechanical simulations.</em>

      <h4 class="text-primary">For Students</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Focus on understanding how the fundamental principles of mechanics are translated into computational models. Practice with simulations to observe how changes in parameters affect the system's behavior, and use hands-on experiments to reinforce your learning.

      <h4 class="text-success">For Lecturers</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        When teaching Part 3, emphasize the practical applications of computational mechanics. Use real-world examples and encourage students to build and test simulations, thus bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and computational implementations in Rust.
