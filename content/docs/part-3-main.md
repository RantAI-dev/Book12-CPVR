<em>Part 3 of CPVR delves into the core principles and techniques of computational mechanics, illustrating how Rust's capabilities enhance the accuracy and efficiency of physical simulations. It begins with numerical methods for solving Newtonian mechanics, laying the groundwork for understanding the motion of bodies under forces. The focus then shifts to simulating rigid body dynamics, highlighting algorithms for predicting and analyzing the behavior of solid objects. The section further explores Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), addressing the complexities of fluid flow simulations and the challenges of resolving various scales and phenomena. It continues with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for structural mechanics, discussing methods for analyzing stress and strain in materials and structures. The final chapter covers Continuum Mechanics Simulations, applying computational techniques to model and analyze materials' continuous behavior under different conditions. This part emphasizes Rust's role in implementing efficient, reliable, and scalable solutions for complex mechanical simulations.</em>
