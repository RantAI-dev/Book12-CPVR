<em>Part I of "CPVR - Computational Physics via Rust" lays the foundational groundwork for the integration of computational physics with the Rust programming language. It begins with an exploration of computational physics, emphasizing its significance in solving complex physical problems through numerical methods and simulations. The section then justifies the choice of Rust for scientific computing, highlighting its advantages in performance and safety. Readers are guided through setting up the computational environment to ensure they have the necessary tools and configurations. The part also covers essential Rust fundamentals tailored for physicists, ensuring a solid understanding of the languageâ€™s core concepts. Finally, it addresses numerical precision and performance in Rust, focusing on how to achieve accurate and efficient computations. This part sets the stage for more advanced topics by establishing a robust foundation in both computational physics and Rust programming.</em>
