<em>Part 6 of CPVR delves into the sophisticated realm of computational electromagnetics, showcasing Rustâ€™s role in accurately modeling and analyzing electromagnetic phenomena. It begins with the foundational principles of Electrostatics and Magnetostatics, exploring static electric and magnetic fields and their interactions. The section advances to the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) Method, a versatile numerical technique for solving Maxwell's equations and capturing time-varying electromagnetic fields. Computational Electrodynamics follows, focusing on the simulation of complex electromagnetic interactions and fields. The discussion then turns to Wave Propagation and Scattering, addressing how waves travel through and interact with different media, and how these interactions can be computed. The final chapter covers Photonic Crystal Simulations, examining materials with periodic structures that influence light propagation. This part highlights how Rustâ€™s computational efficiency and robustness can drive advancements in understanding and applying electromagnetic theory.</em>
