# 24.1. Introduction to Density Functional Theory (DFT)
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a quantum mechanical method primarily used to investigate the electronic structure of many-body systems such as atoms, molecules, and solids. It simplifies the problem of interacting electrons by reformulating it in terms of the electron density, rather than dealing with the many-body wavefunctions directly. This makes DFT computationally more feasible compared to other methods like Hartree-Fock, especially for systems with a large number of particles. The essence of DFT is the mapping of the complex many-electron problem to a simpler one-electron problem, making it highly significant in the field of computational physics.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
DFT finds extensive applications across various scientific fields, including materials science, chemistry, and nanotechnology, where it is used to predict electronic, magnetic, and structural properties. The method is highly valued for its balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, allowing for large-scale simulations of realistic systems. DFT's importance has only grown since its inception, evolving with new computational techniques and improved functionals that enhance its accuracy and range of applications. The historical development of DFT can be traced back to the pioneering work of Walter Kohn, who was instrumental in formulating the key theoretical foundations of the theory. Kohn's work earned him a Nobel Prize, and the evolution of DFT has continued with advances in the exchange-correlation functionals and numerical methods.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The fundamental theoretical framework of DFT rests on two key components: the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems and the Kohn-Sham equations. The first Hohenberg-Kohn theorem states that the ground-state properties of a many-electron system are uniquely determined by its electron density. This theorem establishes that electron density, a three-dimensional quantity, contains all the information required to describe the system, making it the central concept in DFT. The second theorem asserts that there exists a functional of the electron density that can yield the ground-state energy of the system, with the true ground-state density minimizing this functional.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Kohn-Sham equations build on this foundation by introducing auxiliary non-interacting particles to model the electron density of the real system. These particles obey a set of one-electron equations that are much simpler to solve than the full many-body SchrÃ¶dinger equation. The electron density generated by these fictitious particles closely approximates the density of the true interacting system. However, the complexity of electron-electron interactions is encapsulated in a term known as the exchange-correlation energy, which remains an approximation and is crucial for the accuracy of DFT. The development of better exchange-correlation functionals remains an active area of research in DFT, as these functionals account for the quantum mechanical effects of exchange and correlation between electrons, making DFT calculations both more accurate and reliable.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing DFT computationally requires efficient handling of matrix operations, numerical integration, and often parallel computing to handle large systems. Rust, as a systems programming language, is well-suited for these tasks due to its focus on performance, safety, and concurrency. Rust provides low-level control over memory management while also supporting high-level abstractions, making it an ideal choice for scientific computing, including DFT calculations. Libraries such as <code>nalgebra</code> and <code>ndarray</code> can be used for matrix operations and linear algebra computations, which are fundamental to solving the Kohn-Sham equations. Additionally, Rust's <code>rayon</code> crate can be leveraged for parallelism, enabling efficient execution of large-scale DFT simulations across multiple cores.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A practical starting point for DFT in Rust is to set up an environment that supports numerical computing. You would begin by installing key libraries such as <code>nalgebra</code> for linear algebra and <code>ndarray</code> for handling n-dimensional arrays. These libraries are crucial for performing the matrix operations that are central to DFT, such as solving the Kohn-Sham equations and diagonalizing matrices. Below is a sample code that demonstrates a basic matrix operation, which is a common task in DFT computations.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use nalgebra::{DMatrix, DVector};

fn main() {
    // Define a 3x3 matrix (Hamiltonian) representing the system
    let hamiltonian = DMatrix::from_row_slice(3, 3, &[
        1.0, 0.5, 0.2,
        0.5, 2.0, 0.1,
        0.2, 0.1, 3.0,
    ]);

    // Define an initial guess for the wavefunction (eigenvector)
    let wavefunction = DVector::from_vec(vec![0.6, 0.8, 0.5]);

    // Perform a matrix-vector multiplication (H * psi) to compute the energy
    let energy = hamiltonian * wavefunction;

    // Print the resulting energy
    println!("Energy: {:?}", energy);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this simple example, we define a 3x3 matrix representing the Hamiltonian of a system, which is essential in DFT for describing the energy of a quantum system. We also define a vector representing the wavefunction of the system, which in practice would be replaced by the electron density in DFT. The matrix-vector multiplication simulates the operation of applying the Hamiltonian to the wavefunction, resulting in a new vector that represents the system's energy. This type of operation forms the core of solving the Kohn-Sham equations, where the goal is to iteratively solve for the electron density.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Beyond basic operations, Rustâ€™s strength lies in its ability to handle complex calculations safely and efficiently, especially in parallel environments. By using libraries like <code>rayon</code>, we can easily parallelize these calculations. For instance, in large-scale DFT simulations where solving for each electron's behavior independently can be parallelized, Rust can handle these operations safely with minimal overhead. Here's a basic example of parallelizing an operation using <code>rayon</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rayon::prelude::*;
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let hamiltonian = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]; // Simplified representation of a Hamiltonian matrix

    // Shared result variable protected by a Mutex for thread safety
    let result = Mutex::new(vec![0.0; 5]);

    // Parallelized computation of some operations on the Hamiltonian
    hamiltonian.par_iter().enumerate().for_each(|(i, &val)| {
        let mut result_lock = result.lock().unwrap();
        result_lock[i] = val * 2.0; // Example operation: scaling the matrix
    });

    println!("Result: {:?}", result.lock().unwrap());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we use Rustâ€™s parallel iterators provided by <code>rayon</code> to perform element-wise scaling of a simplified Hamiltonian matrix in parallel. Rustâ€™s safety guarantees, such as ensuring that shared resources are protected by a <code>Mutex</code>, allow developers to write efficient, multi-threaded programs without the risk of data races, a key concern in large-scale DFT implementations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Setting up a Rust environment for computational physics involves ensuring the right tools and dependencies are in place. A typical setup would include <code>cargo</code> as the package manager, and scientific libraries like <code>nalgebra</code> for linear algebra, <code>ndarray</code> for multi-dimensional arrays, and <code>rayon</code> for parallelization. With these tools, Rust becomes a powerful platform for executing complex DFT calculations with the added benefit of modern concurrency features that can significantly enhance performance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, DFT is a powerful quantum mechanical tool for investigating many-body systems, and Rust offers the computational features required for implementing DFT effectively. With its emphasis on performance and safety, along with a rich ecosystem of scientific libraries, Rust is well-positioned to handle the numerical and computational challenges of DFT, making it a compelling choice for researchers in computational physics.
</p>

# 24.2. The Hohenberg-Kohn Theorems
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Hohenberg-Kohn theorems form the theoretical foundation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) by simplifying the complex many-body quantum mechanical problem into a problem that can be expressed in terms of the electron density. The first Hohenberg-Kohn theorem states that the electron density uniquely determines the external potential, which, in turn, defines the Hamiltonian of the system. This is a powerful insight because the electron density is a three-dimensional function, regardless of the number of particles in the system. Therefore, solving for the properties of a many-electron system becomes significantly more feasible by focusing on the electron density rather than the complex many-body wavefunction.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The second Hohenberg-Kohn theorem establishes that the ground-state energy of the system is a functional of the electron density. It states that for any electron density that satisfies the correct boundary conditions, the true ground-state energy is the minimum of this functional. This theorem provides a formal method to find the ground-state energy of the system by minimizing this functional with respect to the electron density, leading directly to the framework of DFT. Together, these theorems enable a shift in focus from solving the many-body SchrÃ¶dinger equation to finding an appropriate functional that accurately describes the ground state.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Hohenberg-Kohn theorems simplify the many-body problem by reducing the dimensionality of the systemâ€™s representation. Instead of dealing with the wavefunction, which scales exponentially with the number of particles, the electron density becomes the central quantity. This change enables the use of computational methods that would otherwise be impractical for large systems. The implications of these theorems are far-reaching. For example, they enable the concept of the universal functional, which theoretically applies to all systems and is independent of the external potential. However, finding this universal functional is the core challenge in DFT. In practice, approximations to the functional, such as the Local Density Approximation (LDA) or Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), are used.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The concept of a universal functional highlights the importance of electron density in quantum mechanical calculations. The electron density provides all the necessary information to describe the system, and the success of DFT depends on how accurately this density is determined and how well the chosen functional approximates the true behavior of the electrons. In practical DFT implementations, different strategies, such as grid-based methods or basis-set expansions, are used to represent electron density efficiently and compute the necessary functional values.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing the fundamental ideas of electron density and external potential in Rust requires a combination of numerical methods and efficient data structures. Electron density is typically represented as a continuous function over a three-dimensional space, which can be approximated using either grid-based methods or a basis-set approach. Grid-based methods involve discretizing the space into small elements and representing the density values at each point, while basis-set methods expand the electron density in terms of known functions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, a grid-based approach can be implemented using a three-dimensional array to represent the electron density. For instance, the <code>ndarray</code> crate can be used to create and manipulate multidimensional arrays, which allows for efficient handling of electron density data. The following example demonstrates how to set up a simple electron density grid and compute the external potential:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use ndarray::{Array3, Zip};

fn main() {
    // Define a 3D grid for electron density (100x100x100 grid points)
    let grid_size = 100;
    let mut electron_density = Array3::<f64>::zeros((grid_size, grid_size, grid_size));

    // Initialize electron density with some arbitrary values (e.g., Gaussian distribution)
    let center = grid_size as f64 / 2.0;
    for i in 0..grid_size {
        for j in 0..grid_size {
            for k in 0..grid_size {
                let r_squared = (i as f64 - center).powi(2) + (j as f64 - center).powi(2) + (k as f64 - center).powi(2);
                electron_density[[i, j, k]] = (-r_squared / 50.0).exp();
            }
        }
    }

    // External potential example (e.g., Coulomb potential)
    let mut external_potential = Array3::<f64>::zeros((grid_size, grid_size, grid_size));
    let charge = 1.0; // Simplified point charge
    let epsilon = 1e-6; // Small value to avoid division by zero

    // Calculate the external potential at each grid point
    Zip::from(&mut external_potential).and(&electron_density).for_each(|v_ext, &rho| {
        *v_ext = charge / (rho + epsilon);
    });

    // Print the potential at the center of the grid
    println!("External potential at center: {}", external_potential[[50, 50, 50]]);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we create a 3D grid of <code>100x100x100</code> points to represent the electron density using the <code>ndarray</code> crate. The density is initialized with a Gaussian-like distribution to mimic an electron distribution around a central point. This electron density grid can then be used to compute the external potential, which, in this simplified case, is modeled as a Coulomb potential.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, <code>Zip</code> from the <code>ndarray</code> crate is used to efficiently apply a function to each grid point. The external potential is calculated based on the electron density at each point, taking into account a small value (<code>epsilon</code>) to avoid division by zero when the electron density approaches zero. The result is a 3D array representing the external potential, which can be further used in DFT calculations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To represent the electron density using a basis-set approach, we can expand the density in terms of known functions, such as Gaussian or plane wave basis functions. Rustâ€™s ability to handle efficient numerical computation makes it possible to construct and evaluate these basis functions dynamically. Here is an example of how to expand the electron density using Gaussian basis functions:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use nalgebra::DVector;

fn gaussian_basis(r: f64, alpha: f64) -> f64 {
    (-alpha * r.powi(2)).exp()
}

fn main() {
    let alpha = 0.5; // Gaussian width parameter
    let grid_points = 100; // Number of grid points

    // Create a vector to store the electron density
    let mut electron_density = DVector::zeros(grid_points);

    // Calculate electron density using a Gaussian basis function
    for i in 0..grid_points {
        let r = i as f64 / grid_points as f64 * 10.0; // Scaled radial distance
        electron_density[i] = gaussian_basis(r, alpha);
    }

    // Print the electron density at a sample point
    println!("Electron density at r=5.0: {}", electron_density[50]);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the electron density is calculated using a Gaussian basis function with a width parameter <code>alpha</code>. The <code>DVector</code> from the <code>nalgebra</code> crate is used to store the density values, and we loop through the grid points to evaluate the density at each radial distance. This approach mimics the use of basis sets in DFT and can be scaled up to more complex systems by including multiple basis functions or combining them into linear combinations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Numerical methods, such as grid-based or basis-set approaches, are crucial for accurately representing the electron density in DFT calculations. Rustâ€™s ecosystem, with libraries like <code>ndarray</code> and <code>nalgebra</code>, provides efficient tools for implementing these methods. Moreover, Rustâ€™s strong emphasis on safety and concurrency makes it well-suited for the parallelization of these computations, enabling large-scale simulations in computational physics.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems simplify the many-body quantum mechanical problem by establishing the electron density as the central quantity. These theorems form the foundation for DFT and its practical application to real-world systems. Using Rust, we can efficiently model and manipulate electron density and external potential, leveraging numerical methods and libraries to perform high-precision DFT simulations. The code examples provided illustrate how Rust can be used to implement these key concepts in practice.

# 24.3. The Kohn-Sham Equations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Kohn-Sham equations are central to Density Functional Theory (DFT), as they transform the complex many-body problem of interacting electrons into a more tractable system of single-particle equations. The Kohn-Sham approach introduces auxiliary non-interacting particles that reproduce the same electron density as the real, interacting system. These fictitious particles obey single-particle SchrÃ¶dinger-like equations, but the effect of the electron-electron interactions is encapsulated in a term known as the exchange-correlation potential.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In essence, the Kohn-Sham framework allows us to solve for the electron density by solving a set of simpler equations rather than dealing with the many-electron wavefunction directly. The reformulation relies on dividing the total energy functional into several terms: the kinetic energy of the non-interacting particles, the external potential energy, the Hartree (electron-electron Coulomb) energy, and the exchange-correlation energy. The latter, which accounts for quantum mechanical exchange and correlation effects, is the only term that remains unknown and must be approximated.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Kohn-Sham equations are derived by minimizing the total energy functional with respect to the electron density, subject to the constraint that the number of electrons is conserved. This process results in a set of coupled, nonlinear equations that must be solved iteratively because the potential experienced by the electrons depends on their own distribution, leading to the self-consistent field (SCF) method.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The exchange-correlation functional is a critical component in the Kohn-Sham equations, as it accounts for the complex many-body effects of electron exchange and correlation. While the exact form of the exchange-correlation functional is unknown, various approximations, such as the Local Density Approximation (LDA) and the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), are commonly used. These approximations significantly influence the accuracy of DFT calculations, and choosing the appropriate functional is an important step in setting up DFT simulations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To solve the Kohn-Sham equations, the self-consistent field (SCF) method is employed. In the SCF method, the Kohn-Sham equations are solved iteratively: an initial guess for the electron density is made, and the resulting potential is used to solve the equations. The newly obtained electron density is then compared to the previous one, and the process is repeated until the electron density converges, meaning the difference between successive iterations becomes negligible. This iterative process ensures that the potential used in the equations is self-consistent with the electron density.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing the Kohn-Sham equations in Rust involves setting up the SCF loop and handling the exchange-correlation functionals programmatically. Rustâ€™s capabilities for numerical computation and parallel processing make it well-suited for these tasks. Letâ€™s begin by implementing a simplified version of the SCF loop in Rust.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
First, we define the essential components of the Kohn-Sham equations: the kinetic energy operator, the external potential, the Hartree potential, and the exchange-correlation potential. Below is an example of how we can set up the SCF loop and solve the Kohn-Sham equations iteratively.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use nalgebra::{DMatrix, DVector};

// Function to compute the kinetic energy matrix
fn kinetic_energy_matrix(size: usize) -> DMatrix<f64> {
    let mut matrix = DMatrix::zeros(size, size);
    for i in 0..size {
        for j in 0..size {
            if i == j {
                matrix[(i, j)] = 2.0; // Simplified diagonal kinetic term
            } else if (i as isize - j as isize).abs() == 1 {
                matrix[(i, j)] = -1.0; // Simplified off-diagonal term
            }
        }
    }
    matrix
}

// Function to compute the external potential
fn external_potential(size: usize) -> DVector<f64> {
    DVector::from_element(size, 1.0) // Simplified constant external potential
}

// Function to compute the exchange-correlation potential (LDA approximation)
fn exchange_correlation_potential(density: &DVector<f64>) -> DVector<f64> {
    density.map(|rho| -0.5 * rho.powf(1.0 / 3.0)) // Example LDA functional
}

// Self-Consistent Field (SCF) loop
fn scf_loop(size: usize, max_iterations: usize, tolerance: f64) -> DVector<f64> {
    let kinetic_energy = kinetic_energy_matrix(size);
    let external_pot = external_potential(size);

    // Initial guess for electron density
    let mut density = DVector::from_element(size, 0.5);

    for iteration in 0..max_iterations {
        // Calculate the exchange-correlation potential
        let v_xc = exchange_correlation_potential(&density);

        // Effective potential = external + exchange-correlation
        let effective_potential = &external_pot + &v_xc;

        // Solve the Kohn-Sham equations (simplified diagonalization)
        let hamiltonian = &kinetic_energy + DMatrix::from_diagonal(&effective_potential);
        let eigen = hamiltonian.svd(true, true).unwrap();

        // Update density (using only the lowest eigenvector for simplicity)
        let new_density = eigen.u.unwrap().column(0).map(|val| val.powi(2));

        // Check for convergence
        if (new_density - &density).norm() < tolerance {
            println!("Converged after {} iterations", iteration);
            return new_density;
        }

        // Update the density for the next iteration
        density = new_density;
    }

    println!("Did not converge after {} iterations", max_iterations);
    density
}

fn main() {
    let size = 10; // Size of the system
    let max_iterations = 100; // Maximum number of SCF iterations
    let tolerance = 1e-6; // Convergence tolerance

    // Run the SCF loop to solve the Kohn-Sham equations
    let final_density = scf_loop(size, max_iterations, tolerance);

    println!("Final electron density: {:?}", final_density);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, we begin by defining the kinetic energy matrix, which is a simplified version of the kinetic energy operator. The external potential is represented by a constant vector for simplicity, but in real applications, this potential would vary depending on the system being simulated. The exchange-correlation potential is calculated using a simple Local Density Approximation (LDA) functional, which approximates the potential based on the electron density at each point.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The core of the implementation is the SCF loop, which iteratively solves the Kohn-Sham equations. In each iteration, the effective potential is computed as the sum of the external potential and the exchange-correlation potential. The Hamiltonian matrix, which represents the system's total energy, is constructed by adding the kinetic energy matrix to the effective potential. The resulting matrix is diagonalized to obtain the new electron density, which is compared to the previous density to check for convergence.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The convergence criterion is based on the difference between the current and previous electron densities. If the difference is smaller than a predefined tolerance, the SCF loop stops, indicating that the electron density is self-consistent. If convergence is not achieved within the maximum number of iterations, the loop terminates, and a message is printed indicating that the calculation did not converge.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One key challenge in implementing the Kohn-Sham equations is ensuring numerical stability and achieving convergence efficiently. In real-world applications, the SCF loop often requires sophisticated techniques such as mixing schemes to stabilize the iteration process. These techniques average the electron densities between iterations to prevent oscillations or divergence. Rustâ€™s strong type system and memory safety guarantees make it easier to implement these advanced techniques without introducing bugs or memory issues.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Additionally, handling more complex exchange-correlation functionals programmatically in Rust can involve integrating external scientific libraries or implementing more sophisticated numerical algorithms. Rustâ€™s ecosystem includes libraries for numerical linear algebra and scientific computing, which can be used to extend the basic SCF loop to handle larger and more complex systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, the Kohn-Sham equations reformulate the many-body problem into a set of single-particle equations that can be solved iteratively using the SCF method. The role of exchange-correlation functionals is critical for capturing the many-body effects in the system, and the SCF loop ensures that the electron density is self-consistent with the potential. Using Rust, we can efficiently implement these equations, leverage its concurrency features, and ensure safe and robust execution of the SCF loop for DFT calculations. The sample code provided illustrates how the fundamental concepts of the Kohn-Sham equations can be translated into practical Rust implementations for computational physics.
</p>

# 24.4. Exchange-Correlation Functionals
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Exchange-correlation functionals are at the heart of Density Functional Theory (DFT) because they encapsulate the complex interactions between electrons that arise from quantum mechanical effects. In DFT, the total energy of a many-electron system is expressed as a functional of the electron density, and the exchange-correlation functional accounts for the effects of both exchange (which arises from the Pauli exclusion principle) and correlation (which accounts for the interactions between electrons due to their mutual repulsion). These functionals are essential to the accuracy of DFT calculations, as they directly influence the computed properties of materials, such as total energy, bond lengths, and electronic structure.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The most widely used exchange-correlation functionals can be categorized into three types: the Local Density Approximation (LDA), the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), and hybrid functionals. LDA assumes that the exchange-correlation energy at a point in space depends only on the electron density at that point, making it computationally efficient but sometimes lacking in accuracy for systems with non-uniform electron distributions. GGA improves upon LDA by incorporating the gradient of the electron density, providing more accurate results for systems with varying densities, such as molecules or surfaces. Hybrid functionals take this a step further by mixing a portion of exact exchange energy (calculated using methods like Hartree-Fock) with a traditional DFT exchange-correlation functional, providing improved accuracy, especially for systems with strong electron correlation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Each type of exchange-correlation functional has its strengths and limitations. LDA is computationally inexpensive and works well for simple, homogeneous systems like bulk metals, where the electron density is relatively uniform. However, its limitations become apparent in more complex systems, such as molecules or surfaces, where electron density variations are significant. In such cases, LDA often underestimates important quantities, such as bond lengths and reaction barriers.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
GGA, such as the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, offers improved accuracy by accounting for the spatial variations in electron density. This makes GGA more suitable for systems with complex geometries, such as molecules and solids with surface effects. Despite its improvements, GGA can still struggle with systems that exhibit strong electron correlation, leading to errors in the predicted properties.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hybrid functionals, such as B3LYP, introduce a mix of exact exchange energy, which corrects some of the deficiencies of LDA and GGA. This added accuracy makes hybrid functionals particularly useful for molecular systems and transition states, where electron exchange and correlation effects are more pronounced. However, hybrid functionals are computationally more expensive because the calculation of exact exchange involves evaluating electron-electron integrals, which scales poorly with system size.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The choice of exchange-correlation functional in DFT calculations is a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. While LDA is fast, it may lack accuracy for complex systems. GGA improves accuracy at a moderate increase in computational cost, and hybrid functionals provide the highest accuracy but at a significant computational expense. The challenge in DFT lies in selecting the appropriate functional based on the system being studied and the desired accuracy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, implementing exchange-correlation functionals involves defining the mathematical formulations for each type of functional and applying them to the electron density during DFT calculations. Letâ€™s begin by implementing the Local Density Approximation (LDA) in Rust. The LDA functional depends only on the local value of the electron density and can be expressed as a simple power law for both exchange and correlation energy contributions. Below is a sample implementation of LDA in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use nalgebra::DVector;

    density.map(|rho| factor * rho.powf(1.0 / 3.0))
}

// Local Density Approximation (LDA) correlation functional (simple parametrization)

    // Example electron density (uniform distribution)
    let density = DVector::from_vec(vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]);

    // Compute LDA exchange and correlation potentials
    let v_x = lda_exchange(&density);
    let v_c = lda_correlation(&density);

    // Print results

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we first define the LDA exchange functional, which scales with the electron density to the power of $1/3$. The exchange functional is based on a known analytical expression derived from the homogeneous electron gas model. Similarly, we define the LDA correlation functional, which is a simple logarithmic function of the density. These functions take the electron density as input and return the corresponding exchange and correlation potentials.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>DVector</code> type from the <code>nalgebra</code> crate is used to store the electron density and apply the functional element-wise. This allows us to efficiently compute the exchange-correlation potential for each point in the system. While this example uses a uniform electron density for simplicity, in real DFT calculations, the electron density would be dynamically updated during the SCF loop, and these functionals would be applied at each iteration.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For a more accurate treatment of complex systems, the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) can be implemented. GGA functionals depend not only on the local electron density but also on the gradient of the density. Here is an example of how to implement a simple GGA functional in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use nalgebra::DVector;

// Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) exchange functional (simplified)
fn gga_exchange(density: &DVector<f64>, gradient: &DVector<f64>) -> DVector<f64> {
    let factor = -0.75 * (3.0 / std::f64::consts::PI).powf(1.0 / 3.0);
    density.zip_map(gradient, |rho, grad_rho| factor * rho.powf(1.0 / 3.0) * (1.0 + 0.2 * grad_rho))
}

// Gradient of electron density (simplified numerical derivative)
fn density_gradient(density: &DVector<f64>) -> DVector<f64> {
    let mut gradient = DVector::zeros(density.len());
    for i in 1..density.len() - 1 {
        gradient[i] = (density[i + 1] - density[i - 1]) / 2.0; // Central difference
    }
    gradient
}

fn main() {
    // Example electron density
    let density = DVector::from_vec(vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]);

    // Compute the gradient of the electron density
    let gradient = density_gradient(&density);

    // Compute GGA exchange potential
    let v_x_gga = gga_exchange(&density, &gradient);

    // Print results
    println!("GGA Exchange Potential: {:?}", v_x_gga);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this GGA implementation, we calculate the gradient of the electron density using a simple finite difference method. The GGA exchange functional is then computed as a modification of the LDA exchange, with an additional term that depends on the gradient of the density. This captures the variations in electron density more accurately than LDA, especially in systems where the density is non-uniform.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the challenges in implementing GGA functionals is calculating the gradient of the electron density efficiently. In this example, we used a simple central difference method, but more sophisticated numerical methods may be needed for larger and more complex systems to achieve better accuracy and convergence.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hybrid functionals, which mix exact exchange from Hartree-Fock with DFT exchange-correlation functionals, require even more computational effort due to the need to evaluate electron-electron integrals. While Rustâ€™s performance and concurrency features can be leveraged for this purpose, hybrid functionals are generally more computationally intensive than LDA or GGA.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust-based DFT implementations, it is important to compare the performance of different exchange-correlation functionals in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. LDA functionals are computationally cheaper, making them suitable for large-scale systems where computational cost is a concern. GGA functionals, while more accurate for systems with complex electron distributions, come with increased computational cost due to the need for gradient evaluations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To benchmark these functionals in Rust, one can profile the execution time of DFT simulations using different functionals and compare their accuracy against experimental data or more sophisticated methods. Rustâ€™s performance-oriented features, such as zero-cost abstractions and concurrency via <code>rayon</code>, can be used to parallelize the computation of exchange-correlation potentials, further optimizing the performance for large systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, exchange-correlation functionals play a crucial role in the accuracy of DFT calculations, with each type offering different trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost. Implementing these functionals in Rust involves defining their mathematical formulations and integrating them into the SCF loop for DFT simulations. Rustâ€™s strong performance capabilities, combined with its concurrency features, make it well-suited for handling the computational challenges posed by exchange-correlation functionals, particularly for large and complex systems. The provided sample codes illustrate the implementation of LDA and GGA functionals in Rust, offering a practical foundation for expanding these methods in larger DFT simulations.

# 24.5. Numerical Methods in DFT
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Numerical methods play a pivotal role in Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, enabling the accurate and efficient solution of complex quantum mechanical problems. One of the primary decisions when implementing DFT is selecting an appropriate basis set to represent the electron density and wavefunctions. Common choices include plane waves, which are well-suited for periodic systems like crystals, and atomic orbitals, which are often more appropriate for molecular systems. The choice of basis set influences both the accuracy and computational cost of DFT calculations. Plane waves offer systematic convergence but require a large number of basis functions to describe localized features like core electrons. On the other hand, atomic orbitals can be more efficient for localized systems but may lack flexibility in highly delocalized systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another critical component of DFT is the numerical integration of the total energy functional and the solution of Poissonâ€™s equation, which is used to compute the electrostatic potential. In electrostatic problems, Poissonâ€™s equation relates the electron density to the potential, and solving it efficiently is crucial for the self-consistent field (SCF) loop. Numerical methods like finite difference methods or spectral methods are commonly employed to solve Poissonâ€™s equation, and selecting the appropriate method depends on the system's geometry and boundary conditions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Grid-based methods are one of the most common numerical approaches used in DFT calculations, particularly for systems where the electron density can vary significantly across space. These methods discretize the spatial domain into a grid and solve the equations at each grid point. This approach is particularly useful for solving Poissonâ€™s equation in three dimensions. The accuracy of grid-based methods depends on the resolution of the grid, with finer grids providing more accurate results but increasing computational cost and memory requirements. The trade-off between grid resolution and computational efficiency must be considered carefully, especially in large-scale simulations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the context of solving Poissonâ€™s equation, numerical methods such as finite difference methods can be employed to discretize the second-order partial differential equation. In three-dimensional space, this typically results in a large sparse matrix that can be solved using iterative methods like the conjugate gradient method or direct solvers such as LU decomposition. Efficient memory management and parallelization are key challenges when solving Poissonâ€™s equation for large systems in DFT.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing numerical methods for DFT in Rust requires careful attention to both performance and memory management. Rustâ€™s emphasis on safety and its ownership model make it well-suited for managing memory efficiently in large-scale simulations. To implement grid-based methods, we can use multi-dimensional arrays to represent the grid points, and numerical differentiation can be employed to approximate the derivatives required for solving Poissonâ€™s equation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s begin by implementing a basic grid-based method for solving Poissonâ€™s equation using the finite difference method. In this example, we will discretize the Laplace operator in three dimensions and solve the resulting system using an iterative solver.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, we use a 3D grid to represent the electron density and solve Poissonâ€™s equation using the Jacobi iteration method, which is an iterative approach for solving linear systems. The Laplacian operator is discretized using the finite difference method, where each grid point is updated based on the values of its neighbors. The electron density is initialized using a Gaussian distribution as an example. The solution to Poissonâ€™s equation is the electrostatic potential, which is iteratively updated until convergence is reached or a maximum number of iterations is exceeded.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>Array3</code> type from the <code>ndarray</code> crate is used to represent the 3D grid. By leveraging Rustâ€™s <code>Zip</code> function, we can efficiently apply operations over the grid points in parallel, if needed. In large-scale DFT calculations, this parallelization is critical for handling large systems efficiently. The Jacobi method is simple but can be extended to more advanced solvers such as the conjugate gradient method for improved performance and convergence properties.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To optimize performance further, Rustâ€™s <code>rayon</code> crate can be used to parallelize the loop over grid points. By distributing the workload across multiple threads, we can significantly reduce the runtime for large systems. Hereâ€™s an example of how to parallelize the solution of Poissonâ€™s equation using <code>rayon</code>:
</p>

        }

        potential.assign(&new_potential);
    }
    println!("Max iterations reached.");
    new_potential

{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this parallelized version, we replace the regular iteration with <code>par_iter_mut</code> from the <code>rayon</code> crate, which allows us to process each grid point in parallel. The implementation remains conceptually the same, but it takes advantage of multi-core processors to handle larger systems or more complex grids faster.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Efficient memory management is crucial in large-scale DFT simulations, particularly when working with large grids or basis sets. Rustâ€™s ownership model ensures that memory is managed safely, preventing common issues like memory leaks or dangling pointers. Additionally, Rustâ€™s <code>ndarray</code> crate allows for efficient in-place operations, reducing memory overhead during numerical calculations. When solving large linear systems like Poissonâ€™s equation, care must be taken to minimize unnecessary memory allocations by reusing data structures and taking advantage of Rustâ€™s mutable borrowing system to modify arrays in place.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, numerical methods such as grid-based approaches and solving Poissonâ€™s equation are essential for DFT simulations. In Rust, these methods can be implemented efficiently using multi-dimensional arrays and optimized using parallel computing techniques. The provided sample codes demonstrate how to solve Poissonâ€™s equation using both sequential and parallelized approaches in Rust, highlighting the languageâ€™s strengths in performance and memory management. This makes Rust an excellent choice for implementing large-scale DFT calculations that require both accuracy and computational efficiency.

# 24.6. Self-Consistent Field (SCF) Method
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Self-Consistent Field (SCF) method is a critical part of solving the Kohn-Sham equations in Density Functional Theory (DFT). The Kohn-Sham equations are nonlinear because the potential in which electrons move depends on the electron density itself. The SCF method addresses this nonlinearity through an iterative process. Starting with an initial guess for the electron density, the Kohn-Sham equations are solved to produce a new electron density. This new density is then used to update the potential, and the equations are solved again. The process is repeated until the electron density converges to a self-consistent solution, meaning that the input density used to calculate the potential produces the same density as output from the Kohn-Sham equations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Achieving self-consistency is crucial in DFT calculations because the results, such as total energy, are only meaningful once the electron density and potential are consistent. The convergence criteria are typically based on either the change in total energy between iterations or the change in electron density. A common convergence threshold is when these changes become smaller than a predefined tolerance, indicating that the system has reached a stable configuration. Convergence is necessary to ensure that the physical properties predicted by DFT are accurate and reliable.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the key challenges in the SCF method is achieving convergence, particularly for complex systems where the electron density may change drastically between iterations. Mixing schemes are commonly employed to accelerate convergence and prevent oscillations. Instead of using the new density or potential directly in each iteration, a weighted average of the new and previous densities (or potentials) is taken. This helps dampen oscillations and stabilize the iterative process.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
There are several types of mixing schemes. The simplest is linear mixing, where a fixed proportion of the new density is mixed with the old density. This is computationally inexpensive but may converge slowly. More advanced schemes include Anderson mixing, which dynamically adjusts the mixing parameters to improve convergence. Another approach is Broyden mixing, which uses the history of previous iterations to predict future densities, often leading to faster convergence.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Common challenges in SCF calculations include slow convergence, oscillatory behavior, and the possibility of divergence, where the electron density fails to stabilize. These issues often arise in systems with near-degenerate states or where the initial guess for the electron density is far from the true solution. Strategies to overcome these challenges include using more sophisticated mixing schemes, increasing the accuracy of the initial guess, or preconditioning the system to make convergence more likely.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing the SCF method in Rust involves setting up the iterative loop, applying mixing schemes, and checking for convergence. Rust's performance characteristics, such as its ability to handle concurrent computations and its memory safety features, make it an excellent choice for implementing SCF calculations efficiently. Below is an implementation of a simplified SCF loop with linear mixing in Rust.

    println!("Final electron density: {:?}", final_density);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, we begin by defining a function to compute the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian based on the electron density. The Hamiltonian is simplified here, with diagonal terms determined by the density and off-diagonal terms representing hopping between orbitals. The <code>update_density</code> function takes the lowest eigenvector (representing the ground state) and computes the electron density as the square of its entries.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The core of the SCF method is the <code>scf_loop</code>, which performs the iterative updates. In each iteration, we compute the Hamiltonian, solve for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and update the density. Linear mixing is applied by combining the new and old densities based on a mixing parameter. The loop checks for convergence by comparing the difference between the new and old densities, and if the change is below a predefined tolerance, the loop exits, indicating that self-consistency has been achieved.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This basic implementation of the SCF method can be extended to include more sophisticated mixing schemes. For example, we can implement Anderson mixing, which dynamically adjusts the mixing parameter based on previous iterations. Here is an example of how Anderson mixing could be implemented in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn anderson_mixing(density: &DVector<f64>, old_density: &DVector<f64>, residual: &DVector<f64>, beta: f64) -> DVector<f64> {
    old_density + residual * beta // Anderson mixing: adjust density using residual and mixing factor
}

fn scf_loop_anderson(size: usize, max_iterations: usize, tol: f64, beta: f64) -> DVector<f64> {
    let mut density = DVector::from_element(size, 1.0); // Initial guess
    let mut old_density = density.clone();
    
    for iteration in 0..max_iterations {
        let hamiltonian = compute_hamiltonian(&density, size);
        let eigen = hamiltonian.svd(true, true).unwrap();
        let new_density = update_density(&eigen.u.unwrap().column(0));

        // Calculate residual (difference between new and old densities)
        let residual = &new_density - &density;

        // Apply Anderson mixing
        density = anderson_mixing(&density, &old_density, &residual, beta);

        // Check for convergence
        if residual.norm() < tol {
            println!("Converged after {} iterations with Anderson mixing", iteration);
            return density;
        }

        old_density = density.clone();
    }

    println!("SCF did not converge after {} iterations with Anderson mixing", max_iterations);
    density
}

fn main() {
    let size = 10; // Size of the system (number of orbitals)
    let max_iterations = 100; // Maximum SCF iterations
    let tol = 1e-6; // Convergence tolerance
    let beta = 0.7; // Anderson mixing parameter

    // Run the SCF loop with Anderson mixing
    let final_density = scf_loop_anderson(size, max_iterations, tol, beta);

    println!("Final electron density with Anderson mixing: {:?}", final_density);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this version, Anderson mixing is applied by using the residual (the difference between the new and old densities) to adjust the density. The residual is scaled by a mixing factor <code>beta</code>, which controls how much of the residual is added to the current density. Anderson mixing generally accelerates convergence compared to linear mixing, especially for systems with slow convergence.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Achieving convergence in SCF calculations can be challenging, particularly for systems with near-degenerate states or poor initial guesses for the electron density. Strategies to improve convergence include:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Preconditioning: Modifying the electron density or potential before starting the SCF loop to bring the system closer to the true solution.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Variable Mixing: Adjusting the mixing parameter dynamically during the SCF iterations. Larger values can be used early on to accelerate convergence, while smaller values may help refine the solution in later iterations.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Improved Initial Guess: Starting with an initial electron density that is closer to the final self-consistent density can significantly reduce the number of iterations needed for convergence. For example, using a density from a previous calculation or from a similar system can help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, the Self-Consistent Field (SCF) method is essential for solving the Kohn-Sham equations in DFT. Convergence is crucial for obtaining accurate physical properties, and mixing schemes are a key tool for accelerating the iterative process. Using Rust, the SCF method can be implemented efficiently, with robust handling of different mixing schemes and convergence checks. The provided examples demonstrate the implementation of both linear and Anderson mixing in Rust, illustrating how SCF calculations can be performed effectively in computational physics applications.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing a full Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation from scratch involves multiple stages, from setting up the system and initializing the electron density to solving the Kohn-Sham equations and analyzing the results. A well-structured DFT implementation requires a modular design where each component of the calculation is isolated and interacts efficiently with others. The key stages in a DFT workflow include:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">System setup and initialization, where the physical system (e.g., a molecule or crystal) is defined, and an initial guess for the electron density is made.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Numerical methods for solving equations, such as Poissonâ€™s equation for electrostatics or solving the Kohn-Sham equations.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">The self-consistent field (SCF) loop, which iteratively updates the electron density until self-consistency is achieved.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Analysis of the results, including calculating properties such as total energy, electron density distribution, and molecular orbitals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, each of these stages should be implemented as modular components to ensure that the code is reusable, maintainable, and optimized for performance. Rustâ€™s strong type system and memory management features enable the creation of efficient and safe scientific software, while its ecosystem provides tools for parallelization and numerical computation, which are essential for DFT.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The workflow of a DFT calculation typically follows these steps:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">System Setup and Initialization: At the beginning of the process, we define the system, which includes specifying the atoms, the grid or basis set, and the initial guess for the electron density. This might involve reading from an input file, defining the atomic positions, and initializing the electron density as a simple Gaussian distribution or a superposition of atomic densities.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Numerical Methods: Next, we set up the numerical methods required to solve the Kohn-Sham equations. This includes setting up the Hamiltonian matrix, calculating the exchange-correlation potential, and solving Poissonâ€™s equation for the electrostatic potential. These methods must be efficient and scalable to handle large systems.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Self-Consistent Field (SCF) Loop: The SCF loop iteratively solves the Kohn-Sham equations and updates the electron density until convergence is reached. Mixing schemes are often used to stabilize this process, and convergence criteria are checked after each iteration.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Results Analysis: Once the electron density has converged, the final results are analyzed. This includes calculating the total energy, electron density distribution, and derived properties such as molecular orbitals or band structure in periodic systems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Each of these components interacts with the others. For example, the electron density calculated in one SCF iteration is used to update the Hamiltonian in the next iteration, and the convergence check is based on the difference in densities between iterations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s walk through the step-by-step implementation of a DFT code in Rust. We will focus on modularity and code structure to ensure each part of the DFT workflow is isolated and easy to maintain. Below is an overview of how to implement each stage, with Rust code examples integrated into the explanation.
</p>

#### **Step 1:** System Setup and Initialization
<p style="text-align: justify;">
First, we define a struct to represent the system. This struct will hold information about the atoms, grid, and initial electron density. We can then initialize the electron density as a Gaussian distribution for simplicity.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use ndarray::{Array3, Zip};

// Struct representing the physical system
struct System {
    grid_size: usize,
    electron_density: Array3<f64>, // 3D grid representing electron density
}

// Function to initialize the electron density (e.g., Gaussian distribution)
impl System {
    fn initialize(grid_size: usize) -> Self {
        let mut electron_density = Array3::<f64>::zeros((grid_size, grid_size, grid_size));
        let center = grid_size as f64 / 2.0;

        for i in 0..grid_size {
            for j in 0..grid_size {
                for k in 0..grid_size {
                    let r_squared = (i as f64 - center).powi(2)
                        + (j as f64 - center).powi(2)
                        + (k as f64 - center).powi(2);
                    electron_density[[i, j, k]] = (-r_squared / 50.0).exp();
                }
            }
        }

        Self { grid_size, electron_density }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let grid_size = 50; // Grid size
    let system = System::initialize(grid_size);
    
    // Print a sample value from the initialized electron density
    println!("Initial electron density at center: {}", system.electron_density[[grid_size / 2, grid_size / 2, grid_size / 2]]);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, we define the <code>System</code> struct, which includes the grid size and a 3D array for the electron density. The <code>initialize</code> method fills the electron density array with values based on a Gaussian distribution, which serves as an initial guess.
</p>

#### **Step 2:** Numerical Methods
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Next, we implement the numerical methods required to solve Poissonâ€™s equation and calculate the exchange-correlation potential. Weâ€™ll use finite difference methods for Poissonâ€™s equation and a simple Local Density Approximation (LDA) for the exchange-correlation potential.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Function to solve Poisson's equation using finite difference method
fn solve_poisson(density: &Array3<f64>, grid_size: usize, max_iter: usize, tol: f64) -> Array3<f64> {
    let mut potential = Array3::<f64>::zeros((grid_size, grid_size, grid_size));
    let mut new_potential = potential.clone();

    for _ in 0..max_iter {
        Zip::indexed(&mut new_potential).for_each(|(i, j, k), v| {
            if i > 0 && i < grid_size - 1 && j > 0 && j < grid_size - 1 && k > 0 && k < grid_size - 1 {
                *v = 0.25
                    * (potential[[i + 1, j, k]]
                        + potential[[i - 1, j, k]]
                        + potential[[i, j + 1, k]]
                        + potential[[i, j - 1, k]]
                        + potential[[i, j, k + 1]]
                        + potential[[i, j, k - 1]]
                        - density[[i, j, k]] / (4.0 * std::f64::consts::PI));
            }
        });

        if (&new_potential - &potential).iter().map(|&x| x.abs()).sum::<f64>() < tol {
            break;
        }

        potential.assign(&new_potential);
    }

    new_potential
}

// Simple LDA exchange-correlation functional
fn lda_exchange_correlation(density: &Array3<f64>) -> Array3<f64> {
    density.map(|rho| -0.75 * (3.0 / std::f64::consts::PI).powf(1.0 / 3.0) * rho.powf(1.0 / 3.0))
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we implement the Poisson solver using the finite difference method to compute the electrostatic potential. We also define the LDA exchange-correlation functional, which calculates the exchange-correlation potential based on the electron density.
</p>

#### **Step 3:** Self-Consistent Field (SCF) Loop
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The SCF loop is the heart of the DFT implementation. Here, we solve the Kohn-Sham equations iteratively, updating the electron density until convergence is achieved.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn scf_loop(system: &mut System, max_iter: usize, tol: f64, mixing_param: f64) {
    let mut old_density = system.electron_density.clone();

    for iteration in 0..max_iter {
        // Solve Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential
        let potential = solve_poisson(&system.electron_density, system.grid_size, 100, tol);

        // Compute exchange-correlation potential
        let v_xc = lda_exchange_correlation(&system.electron_density);

        // Update Hamiltonian and solve for new electron density (simplified)
        // In a real implementation, we would compute eigenvalues/eigenvectors here
        let new_density = &potential + &v_xc; // Simplified update for demo purposes

        // Mixing scheme: linear mixing
        system.electron_density = &old_density * (1.0 - mixing_param) + &new_density * mixing_param;

        // Check for convergence
        let diff = (&system.electron_density - &old_density).iter().map(|&x| x.abs()).sum::<f64>();
        if diff < tol {
            println!("SCF converged after {} iterations", iteration);
            return;
        }

        // Update old density for next iteration
        old_density = system.electron_density.clone();
    }

    println!("SCF did not converge after {} iterations", max_iter);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the SCF loop, we first solve Poissonâ€™s equation to compute the electrostatic potential, then calculate the exchange-correlation potential using the LDA functional. The electron density is updated based on these potentials, and linear mixing is applied to stabilize the iterative process. Convergence is checked after each iteration by comparing the new and old electron densities.
</p>

#### **Step 4:** Results Analysis
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Once the SCF loop converges, we can extract useful information from the results, such as the total energy or electron density distribution. For example, we can print the final electron density or compute derived quantities like molecular orbitals.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let grid_size = 50;
    let max_iter = 100;
    let tol = 1e-6;
    let mixing_param = 0.5;

    let mut system = System::initialize(grid_size);

    // Run the SCF loop
    scf_loop(&mut system, max_iter, tol, mixing_param);

    // Print final electron density at center
    println!("Final electron density at center: {}", system.electron_density[[grid_size / 2, grid_size / 2, grid_size / 2]]);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this final step, we run the SCF loop and print the final electron density after the calculation has converged. In a more complete DFT implementation, we would also compute properties such as total energy, forces on atoms, or band structure.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Practical Tips for Optimization:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Modularity: Ensure each component (system setup, numerical methods, SCF loop) is modular to allow for easier debugging, testing, and future improvements.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Parallelization: Use Rustâ€™s <code>rayon</code> crate for parallelizing the SCF loop or Poisson solver to speed up large-scale DFT calculations.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Memory Management: Take advantage of Rustâ€™s ownership and borrowing model to manage large arrays efficiently and prevent unnecessary memory allocations.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Debugging: Rustâ€™s compile-time checks and error messages are valuable for debugging issues related to memory safety and array bounds, making it easier to track down issues in large DFT codebases.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, implementing DFT in Rust involves building a structured and modular program that integrates the SCF method, numerical solvers, and exchange-correlation functionals. Rustâ€™s features make it well-suited for this type of scientific computing, ensuring both high performance and safety. The sample code provided offers a foundation for building more advanced DFT implementations in Rust, with a focus on modularity and optimization.

# 24.8. Parallelization and High-Performance Computing in DFT
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Parallel computing is critical to scaling Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to larger systems and more complex materials. DFT simulations often involve the solution of large linear systems, the computation of electron densities across vast grids, and the iterative self-consistent field (SCF) method. As system size increases, so does the computational cost, making it essential to leverage parallel computing and high-performance computing (HPC) techniques.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
High-performance computing allows for the decomposition of DFT calculations into smaller, parallelizable tasks, enabling the efficient use of multiple processors and cores. This approach significantly reduces computation time for large systems and enables simulations of materials with complex electronic structures, such as biomolecules, nanomaterials, and condensed matter systems. HPC environments often rely on strategies such as domain decomposition (dividing the computational grid or space into smaller subdomains) and data parallelism (distributing data across multiple processors). These techniques, combined with efficient memory management, allow DFT simulations to scale efficiently on modern multi-core and distributed systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the context of DFT, several parallelization strategies can be employed:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Domain Decomposition: The simulation domain (e.g., the electron density grid) is divided into smaller subdomains, each handled by a separate processor. This method is well-suited for grid-based methods in DFT, where each subdomain can be processed independently before being combined into the final solution. For instance, Poissonâ€™s equation, which governs the electrostatic potential, can be solved in parallel by decomposing the spatial grid into smaller chunks and solving them simultaneously.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Data Parallelism: Data parallelism involves distributing different parts of the data, such as matrix elements or grid points, across multiple processors. This is particularly useful for tasks like matrix operations (e.g., matrix diagonalization) or evaluating the electron density at each point in space. In Rust, this type of parallelism can be efficiently implemented using the <code>rayon</code> crate, which simplifies multi-threaded parallel execution.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Task Parallelism: Task parallelism assigns different parts of the computational workload to different processors. For example, in a DFT calculation, one processor may handle solving the Kohn-Sham equations while another processes the exchange-correlation functional calculations. Task parallelism can be effectively combined with data parallelism to further optimize performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s concurrency model, combined with external libraries like <code>rayon</code> and <code>tokio</code>, provides powerful tools for implementing these parallelization strategies in a safe and efficient way. Rustâ€™s strict memory management ensures that data races are prevented, making it easier to develop reliable parallel DFT codes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s look at practical implementations of parallel DFT simulations in Rust, focusing on parallelizing different components of the calculation using Rustâ€™s concurrency features.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In a DFT calculation, solving Poissonâ€™s equation is a critical step in determining the electrostatic potential. Using domain decomposition, we can divide the 3D grid into smaller subdomains and solve each one in parallel. Rustâ€™s <code>rayon</code> crate allows us to easily parallelize the computation over different sections of the grid.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rayon::prelude::*;
use ndarray::{Array3, Zip};

// Function to solve Poisson's equation in parallel using domain decomposition
fn solve_poisson_parallel(density: &Array3<f64>, grid_size: usize, max_iter: usize, tol: f64) -> Array3<f64> {
    let mut potential = Array3::<f64>::zeros((grid_size, grid_size, grid_size));
    let mut new_potential = potential.clone();

    for _ in 0..max_iter {
        new_potential.par_iter_mut().enumerate().for_each(|(index, v)| {
            let i = index / (grid_size * grid_size);
            let j = (index / grid_size) % grid_size;
            let k = index % grid_size;

            if i > 0 && i < grid_size - 1 && j > 0 && j < grid_size - 1 && k > 0 && k < grid_size - 1 {
                *v = 0.25
                    * (potential[[i + 1, j, k]]
                        + potential[[i - 1, j, k]]
                        + potential[[i, j + 1, k]]
                        + potential[[i, j - 1, k]]
                        + potential[[i, j, k + 1]]
                        + potential[[i, j, k - 1]]
                        - density[[i, j, k]] / (4.0 * std::f64::consts::PI));
            }
        });

        // Check for convergence (global check over all grid points)
        let diff: f64 = (&new_potential - &potential).par_iter().map(|&x| x.abs()).sum();
        if diff < tol {
            println!("Converged.");
            break;
        }

        potential.assign(&new_potential);
    }

    new_potential

fn main() {

    let max_iter = 1000;
    let tol = 1e-6;

    // Example electron density
    let density = Array3::from_elem((grid_size, grid_size, grid_size), 1.0);

    // Solve Poisson's equation in parallel
    let potential = solve_poisson_parallel(&density, grid_size, max_iter, tol);

    // Print the potential at the center of the grid
    println!("Potential at center: {}", potential[[grid_size / 2, grid_size / 2, grid_size / 2]]);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we parallelize the computation of the electrostatic potential over a 3D grid using Rust's <code>rayon</code> crate. The grid is split across different threads, with each thread solving for a portion of the grid independently. The results are then combined, and a convergence check is performed across all grid points. This approach is ideal for large-scale DFT calculations where solving Poissonâ€™s equation can be a computational bottleneck.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The SCF loop can also be parallelized to improve performance, especially when evaluating the Hamiltonian matrix or calculating the exchange-correlation potential. In this case, we can parallelize matrix operations and electron density updates using <code>rayon</code>.

    // Print final electron density

}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this SCF loop implementation, we parallelize the Hamiltonian matrix construction using <code>rayon</code>. Each element of the Hamiltonian is calculated in parallel, reducing the computational time, especially for large systems. After constructing the Hamiltonian, we solve the simplified eigenvalue problem to update the electron density. Parallelization at this stage allows the SCF loop to handle larger systems with increased efficiency.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Optimizing Rust-based DFT codes for high-performance computing environments requires a few key considerations:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Memory Management: Efficient memory usage is crucial for large-scale DFT simulations. Rustâ€™s ownership model and strict borrowing rules help prevent memory leaks and ensure efficient memory allocation. However, when dealing with large matrices or grids, careful management of memory allocation and reuse is essential to avoid unnecessary overhead.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Parallelization Granularity: It's important to ensure that tasks being parallelized are large enough to justify the overhead of parallelization. For example, parallelizing very small matrix operations may result in diminishing returns due to the overhead of managing threads. Profiling the code using tools like <code>cargo flamegraph</code> can help identify where parallelism would be most effective.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Task Scheduling: For complex DFT simulations that involve multiple types of operations (e.g., matrix operations, solving differential equations, SCF iterations), task parallelism can be used to distribute different tasks across processors. Libraries such as <code>tokio</code> can be used for more advanced scheduling and concurrency control.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Distributed Computing: Rust-based DFT codes can be extended to run on distributed systems by using libraries like <code>mpi-rs</code> for message-passing between nodes. This enables DFT simulations to scale beyond the limitations of a single machine by distributing the workload across multiple machines in a high-performance cluster.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Parallelization and high-performance computing are essential for scaling DFT simulations to handle larger and more complex systems. Rustâ€™s concurrency features and external libraries like <code>rayon</code> provide the tools necessary to implement parallel DFT calculations efficiently. By parallelizing components such as the Poisson solver and the SCF loop, Rust-based DFT codes can be optimized for large-scale simulations on multi-core and distributed computing environments. The examples provided demonstrate how to implement domain decomposition, data parallelism, and matrix operations in parallel, paving the way for more advanced and scalable DFT implementations in Rust.

# 24.9. Case Studies: Applications of DFT
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Density Functional Theory (DFT) is widely used in real-world applications across various fields such as materials science, chemistry, and nanotechnology. DFT enables scientists to investigate and predict the properties of materials and molecules by solving quantum mechanical equations that govern the behavior of electrons. Its ability to model complex systems with relatively low computational cost compared to other quantum mechanical methods makes DFT a powerful tool for understanding key properties like electronic structure, band gaps, reaction mechanisms, and material stability.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In materials science, DFT is commonly used to calculate the electronic structure and predict properties such as conductivity, magnetism, and optical behavior. In chemistry, DFT is used to explore reaction mechanisms, transition states, and the interaction between molecules. It also plays a vital role in nanotechnology, where it helps design new nanomaterials with desired properties by providing insights into their atomic-level behavior. The application of DFT to these areas provides researchers with the ability to simulate experiments that would otherwise be costly or difficult to perform in a laboratory.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Several case studies illustrate the use of DFT to solve practical problems. For instance, DFT can be used to calculate the band structure of semiconductors and insulators, which is critical for designing electronic devices. By solving the Kohn-Sham equations for a material, researchers can determine the materialâ€™s band gap, helping identify potential candidates for use in transistors or solar cells.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another common application is studying reaction mechanisms in chemistry. DFT is employed to map out potential energy surfaces and identify the energy barriers associated with chemical reactions. This provides insights into the reaction pathways, which can help in designing more efficient catalysts. For example, DFT simulations of transition metal catalysts in industrial processes allow for a deeper understanding of the interactions at the atomic level, leading to the optimization of catalytic activity.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In nanotechnology, DFT has been used to investigate the stability of new nanomaterials like graphene, nanowires, or quantum dots. By simulating the arrangement of atoms and calculating the resulting electronic and mechanical properties, researchers can predict the behavior of these materials under various conditions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s now walk through a practical case study in Rust. We will implement a DFT-based approach to calculate the band structure of a simple material (e.g., graphene) and analyze the electronic properties. This example will demonstrate how DFT is applied in real-world scenarios and how the computational results can be interpreted.
</p>

### **Case Study:** Band Structure Calculation of Graphene
#### **Step 1:** Setting Up the System
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Graphene is a two-dimensional material composed of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. Its unique electronic properties, such as its zero band gap and high electrical conductivity, make it an excellent candidate for DFT studies. We begin by defining the atomic structure and initializing the electron density.
</p>

    fn new() -> Self {
        // Hexagonal lattice vectors for graphene

        Self {
            num_atoms: 2, // Each unit cell has two carbon atoms
            lattice_vectors,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Initialize the graphene lattice
    let graphene = GrapheneLattice::new();
    println!("Graphene lattice initialized with {} atoms per unit cell.", graphene.num_atoms);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, we initialize the graphene lattice with two atoms per unit cell. The lattice vectors define the periodicity of the material. This setup represents the atomic structure of graphene and forms the basis for calculating the electronic properties.
</p>

#### **Step 2:** Hamiltonian Matrix and Kohn-Sham Equations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
We now set up the Hamiltonian matrix based on the tight-binding model to approximate the interactions between carbon atoms. The Hamiltonian describes the energy of electrons moving through the graphene lattice, and solving the Kohn-Sham equations will give us the eigenvalues (energies) and eigenvectors (wavefunctions) corresponding to different electron states.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use nalgebra::{DMatrix, DVector};

// Function to build the tight-binding Hamiltonian matrix for graphene
fn build_hamiltonian(kx: f64, ky: f64) -> DMatrix<f64> {
    let t = -2.7; // Nearest-neighbor hopping energy in eV (typical for graphene)
    let mut hamiltonian = DMatrix::zeros(2, 2);

    // Hamiltonian elements based on nearest-neighbor interactions
    hamiltonian[(0, 1)] = t * (1.0 + f64::exp(1.0 * kx) + f64::exp(1.0 * ky));
    hamiltonian[(1, 0)] = hamiltonian[(0, 1)]; // Hermitian property

    hamiltonian
}

// Function to calculate the band structure (energies)
fn calculate_band_structure(k_points: &Vec<(f64, f64)>) -> Vec<f64> {
    let mut energies = Vec::new();
    for &(kx, ky) in k_points {
        let hamiltonian = build_hamiltonian(kx, ky);
        let eigenvalues = hamiltonian.svd(true, true).unwrap().singular_values;
        energies.push(eigenvalues[0]); // Take the lowest energy eigenvalue
    }
    energies
}

fn main() {
    // Define a path through the Brillouin zone (k-space) for graphene
    let k_points = vec![
        (0.0, 0.0), (0.5, 0.0), (0.5, 0.5), (0.0, 0.5) // Simplified for example
    ];

    // Calculate the band structure
    let band_structure = calculate_band_structure(&k_points);

    // Print the energies (band structure)
    for (i, energy) in band_structure.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("k-point {}: Energy = {:.3} eV", i, energy);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this step, we construct the Hamiltonian matrix based on the nearest-neighbor hopping energy of graphene, using a tight-binding model. The matrix is then diagonalized to obtain the eigenvalues, which represent the energy of electrons at each k-point in the Brillouin zone. This gives us the band structure of graphene, which can be used to analyze its electronic properties.
</p>

#### **Step 3:** Analyzing the Results
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The band structure calculated in the previous step can be analyzed to determine key properties of graphene. For example, graphene's unique zero band gap (at the Dirac point) is a defining feature of its electronic behavior. By plotting the band structure, we can visualize the electronic dispersion in graphene and identify the energy levels where the conduction and valence bands meet.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To further illustrate how DFT can be applied in material science, letâ€™s discuss another case study focused on reaction mechanisms in catalysis.
</p>

### **Case Study:** Reaction Mechanism in Transition Metal Catalysis
#### **Step 1:** Setting Up the Catalyst
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In catalytic reactions, DFT is often used to simulate the interaction between reactants and the catalystâ€™s surface. Letâ€™s assume we are studying a reaction on the surface of a transition metal catalyst (e.g., platinum). The first step is to model the catalystâ€™s surface and initialize the electron density.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Struct representing a catalyst surface
struct Catalyst {
    metal: String,
    surface_atoms: usize,
}

// Function to initialize the catalyst
impl Catalyst {
    fn new(metal: String, surface_atoms: usize) -> Self {
        Self {
            metal,
            surface_atoms,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let catalyst = Catalyst::new("Platinum".to_string(), 100);
    println!("Catalyst initialized: {} atoms on {} surface.", catalyst.surface_atoms, catalyst.metal);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we define the catalyst surface as a simple collection of surface atoms. For a more complete implementation, you would use a realistic atomic structure of the catalystâ€™s surface.
</p>

#### **Step 2:** Simulating the Reaction Pathway
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Next, we simulate the reaction pathway by calculating the energy barrier for the reaction. Using DFT, we compute the total energy at different points along the reaction coordinate, allowing us to map out the potential energy surface.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Function to simulate reaction energy at different points
fn reaction_energy(reaction_coordinate: f64) -> f64 {
    // Simplified energy barrier model
    let activation_energy = 1.2; // eV
    activation_energy * (1.0 - f64::exp(-reaction_coordinate.powi(2)))
}

fn main() {
    // Simulate reaction energy along the reaction coordinate
    for rc in 0..10 {
        let energy = reaction_energy(rc as f64 / 10.0);
        println!("Reaction coordinate {}: Energy = {:.3} eV", rc, energy);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This simplified code simulates the energy profile of a reaction on the catalystâ€™s surface, showing how DFT can be used to predict reaction mechanisms and energy barriers.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When applying DFT to real-world problems, several challenges can arise. One of the most common is the computational cost, especially for large systems or when using advanced exchange-correlation functionals like hybrid functionals. Balancing accuracy and computational efficiency is essential. Moreover, the choice of basis set and the initial guess for electron density can have a significant impact on convergence and results accuracy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
From the Rust-based implementations, managing memory efficiently and optimizing code for parallel execution are crucial for large-scale DFT simulations. Rustâ€™s strong memory safety features help mitigate issues such as data races and memory leaks, which are particularly important in high-performance computing (HPC) environments.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, DFT provides powerful tools for solving real-world problems in materials science, chemistry, and nanotechnology. Rustâ€™s concurrency features, efficient memory management, and numerical computing libraries make it a suitable language for implementing and optimizing DFT simulations. The case studies presented here demonstrate how DFT can be applied to practical problems such as band structure calculations and reaction mechanisms, illustrating its potential for advancing scientific research.

# 24.10. Challenges and Future Directions in DFT
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Despite its success in predicting material properties and chemical reactions, Density Functional Theory (DFT) faces several inherent challenges that limit its accuracy and applicability to certain problems. One of the primary challenges is the accuracy of exchange-correlation functionals. The exact form of the exchange-correlation energy is unknown, and commonly used approximations like the Local Density Approximation (LDA) and Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) are often insufficient, especially for systems involving strong correlations or non-local interactions. These functionals can introduce errors when predicting properties like bond energies, band gaps, and reaction barriers, particularly in systems like transition metals or molecules with van der Waals forces.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another significant challenge is the computational cost of DFT, particularly when simulating large systems or employing more sophisticated functionals, such as hybrid functionals (which combine DFT with Hartree-Fock exchange). These calculations scale poorly with system size, limiting the ability to simulate very large molecules, surfaces, or nanostructures.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The treatment of excited states is also a challenge for DFT, which traditionally focuses on ground-state properties. While DFT can approximate excited-state phenomena through extensions like time-dependent DFT (TDDFT), these approaches can still struggle with accuracy, especially in systems with complex electronic excitations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Emerging trends in DFT research aim to address these limitations. One such trend is the development of time-dependent DFT (TDDFT), which extends DFT to study the dynamic behavior of systems under external perturbations, such as time-varying electric fields. TDDFT is increasingly used in the study of optical properties, excited states, and non-equilibrium phenomena, but challenges remain in improving the accuracy and scalability of TDDFT for large systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another trend is the incorporation of machine learning-enhanced functionals, where machine learning algorithms are trained on high-level quantum mechanical data to develop more accurate functionals. These machine learning models can improve the prediction of exchange-correlation energy and offer significant speedups for DFT calculations, although integrating these models into existing DFT frameworks poses its own challenges.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The integration of DFT with quantum computing represents a promising future direction. Quantum computers could potentially solve certain quantum mechanical problems more efficiently than classical computers, including the accurate calculation of electronic structure. While still in its early stages, research into hybrid DFT-quantum computing algorithms is gaining traction, with the potential to revolutionize how electronic structure calculations are performed.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Integration with Quantum Computing: DFT researchers are exploring the integration of classical DFT methods with quantum computing techniques, particularly for solving the SchrÃ¶dinger equation and calculating electron correlation. Quantum algorithms like the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) could offer more accurate solutions for electronic structure problems that are difficult for classical DFT to handle. This would allow for significant improvements in simulating complex systems like high-temperature superconductors and strongly correlated materials.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Improving Exchange-Correlation Functionals: The development of new exchange-correlation functionals is a key area of focus. Efforts to combine machine learning techniques with high-level quantum chemical methods, such as coupled-cluster theory, aim to create more accurate functionals without dramatically increasing computational costs. Machine learning-enhanced DFT functionals are trained on large datasets of molecular and materials properties, which could lead to more reliable predictions across a wide range of systems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The evolving Rust ecosystem offers several opportunities for addressing the current challenges in DFT, particularly in terms of performance optimization and high-performance computing (HPC). Rustâ€™s memory safety, concurrency model, and focus on performance make it an ideal language for developing advanced DFT algorithms and handling the computational challenges posed by large-scale simulations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s explore how TDDFT could be implemented in Rust for simulating time-dependent phenomena in materials. We begin by defining the time-dependent Hamiltonian and propagating the wavefunction using numerical methods like the Crank-Nicolson scheme. The following code demonstrates how to propagate the wavefunction in time using a time-dependent Hamiltonian:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use nalgebra::{DMatrix, DVector};

// Function to create a time-dependent Hamiltonian
fn time_dependent_hamiltonian(t: f64, size: usize) -> DMatrix<f64> {
    let mut hamiltonian = DMatrix::zeros(size, size);
    let t_factor = (t * 2.0 * std::f64::consts::PI).sin(); // Time-varying component
    for i in 0..size {
        for j in 0..size {
            if i == j {
                hamiltonian[(i, j)] = 1.0 + t_factor; // Diagonal time-dependent potential
            } else {
                hamiltonian[(i, j)] = -1.0; // Off-diagonal hopping terms
            }
        }
    }
    hamiltonian
}

// Crank-Nicolson time propagation
fn crank_nicolson_propagate(psi: &DVector<f64>, hamiltonian: &DMatrix<f64>, dt: f64) -> DVector<f64> {
    let id = DMatrix::<f64>::identity(psi.len(), psi.len());
    let lhs = &id - hamiltonian * (dt / 2.0);
    let rhs = &id + hamiltonian * (dt / 2.0);
    let next_psi = lhs.try_inverse().unwrap() * (rhs * psi);
    next_psi
}

fn main() {
    let size = 10; // Size of the system (number of orbitals)
    let dt = 0.01; // Time step
    let time_steps = 1000; // Number of time steps

    // Initialize wavefunction (simple Gaussian for demo)
    let mut psi = DVector::from_element(size, 1.0 / (size as f64).sqrt());

    for t in 0..time_steps {
        let time = t as f64 * dt;
        let hamiltonian = time_dependent_hamiltonian(time, size);
        psi = crank_nicolson_propagate(&psi, &hamiltonian, dt);

        if t % 100 == 0 {
            println!("Wavefunction at time step {}: {:?}", t, psi);
        }
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, we simulate the time evolution of a wavefunction using a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian includes a time-varying potential, and the wavefunction is propagated in time using the Crank-Nicolson method, a numerically stable scheme for solving time-dependent differential equations. Rustâ€™s strong performance and memory safety ensure that this implementation runs efficiently and safely, even for large systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s concurrency features make it particularly well-suited for high-performance computing environments. Parallelizing DFT simulations can be achieved using libraries such as <code>rayon</code> for thread-based parallelism or by integrating with MPI (Message Passing Interface) for distributed computing across nodes in a cluster. Hereâ€™s how we can parallelize the TDDFT propagation using <code>rayon</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rayon::prelude::*;
use nalgebra::{DMatrix, DVector};

// Parallel Crank-Nicolson time propagation
fn parallel_crank_nicolson(psi: &DVector<f64>, hamiltonian: &DMatrix<f64>, dt: f64) -> DVector<f64> {
    let id = DMatrix::<f64>::identity(psi.len(), psi.len());
    let lhs = &id - hamiltonian * (dt / 2.0);
    let rhs = &id + hamiltonian * (dt / 2.0);
    
    let next_psi = lhs.try_inverse().unwrap() * (rhs * psi);
    next_psi
}

fn main() {
    let size = 1000; // Larger system size for parallelism
    let dt = 0.01;
    let time_steps = 1000;

    let mut psi = DVector::from_element(size, 1.0 / (size as f64).sqrt());

    (0..time_steps).into_par_iter().for_each(|t| {
        let time = t as f64 * dt;
        let hamiltonian = time_dependent_hamiltonian(time, size);
        psi = parallel_crank_nicolson(&psi, &hamiltonian, dt);

        if t % 100 == 0 {
            println!("Wavefunction at time step {}: {:?}", t, psi);
        }
    });
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this version, we parallelize the time propagation using <code>rayon</code>. The Crank-Nicolson propagation is distributed across multiple threads, enabling faster computation for large systems. This parallelism ensures that time-dependent DFT simulations scale effectively, allowing for the simulation of more complex and larger-scale systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust is positioned to play an important role in advancing DFT research, especially as the field moves towards high-performance and distributed computing environments. The languageâ€™s safety features, high performance, and support for concurrency provide the tools needed to develop next-generation DFT algorithms. Additionally, Rustâ€™s integration with emerging technologies such as machine learning and quantum computing will help address the limitations of traditional DFT methods, particularly in the context of improving exchange-correlation functionals and solving complex quantum mechanical problems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, DFT faces several challenges related to the accuracy of functionals, computational cost, and the treatment of excited states. However, emerging trends such as TDDFT, machine learning-enhanced functionals, and the integration of quantum computing offer promising solutions.

# 24.2. The Hohenberg-Kohn Theorems
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Hohenberg-Kohn theorems form the theoretical foundation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) by simplifying the complex many-body quantum mechanical problem into a problem that can be expressed in terms of the electron density. The first Hohenberg-Kohn theorem states that the electron density uniquely determines the external potential, which, in turn, defines the Hamiltonian of the system. This is a powerful insight because the electron density is a three-dimensional function, regardless of the number of particles in the system. Therefore, solving for the properties of a many-electron system becomes significantly more feasible by focusing on the electron density rather than the complex many-body wavefunction.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The second Hohenberg-Kohn theorem establishes that the ground-state energy of the system is a functional of the electron density. It states that for any electron density that satisfies the correct boundary conditions, the true ground-state energy is the minimum of this functional. This theorem provides a formal method to find the ground-state energy of the system by minimizing this functional with respect to the electron density, leading directly to the framework of DFT. Together, these theorems enable a shift in focus from solving the many-body SchrÃ¶dinger equation to finding an appropriate functional that accurately describes the ground state.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Hohenberg-Kohn theorems simplify the many-body problem by reducing the dimensionality of the systemâ€™s representation. Instead of dealing with the wavefunction, which scales exponentially with the number of particles, the electron density becomes the central quantity. This change enables the use of computational methods that would otherwise be impractical for large systems. The implications of these theorems are far-reaching. For example, they enable the concept of the universal functional, which theoretically applies to all systems and is independent of the external potential. However, finding this universal functional is the core challenge in DFT. In practice, approximations to the functional, such as the Local Density Approximation (LDA) or Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), are used.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The concept of a universal functional highlights the importance of electron density in quantum mechanical calculations. The electron density provides all the necessary information to describe the system, and the success of DFT depends on how accurately this density is determined and how well the chosen functional approximates the true behavior of the electrons. In practical DFT implementations, different strategies, such as grid-based methods or basis-set expansions, are used to represent electron density efficiently and compute the necessary functional values.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing the fundamental ideas of electron density and external potential in Rust requires a combination of numerical methods and efficient data structures. Electron density is typically represented as a continuous function over a three-dimensional space, which can be approximated using either grid-based methods or a basis-set approach. Grid-based methods involve discretizing the space into small elements and representing the density values at each point, while basis-set methods expand the electron density in terms of known functions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, a grid-based approach can be implemented using a three-dimensional array to represent the electron density. For instance, the <code>ndarray</code> crate can be used to create and manipulate multidimensional arrays, which allows for efficient handling of electron density data. The following example demonstrates how to set up a simple electron density grid and compute the external potential:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use ndarray::{Array3, Zip};

fn main() {
    // Define a 3D grid for electron density (100x100x100 grid points)
    let grid_size = 100;
    let mut electron_density = Array3::<f64>::zeros((grid_size, grid_size, grid_size));

    // Initialize electron density with some arbitrary values (e.g., Gaussian distribution)
    let center = grid_size as f64 / 2.0;
    for i in 0..grid_size {
        for j in 0..grid_size {
            for k in 0..grid_size {
                let r_squared = (i as f64 - center).powi(2) + (j as f64 - center).powi(2) + (k as f64 - center).powi(2);
                electron_density[[i, j, k]] = (-r_squared / 50.0).exp();
            }
        }
    }

    // External potential example (e.g., Coulomb potential)
    let mut external_potential = Array3::<f64>::zeros((grid_size, grid_size, grid_size));
    let charge = 1.0; // Simplified point charge
    let epsilon = 1e-6; // Small value to avoid division by zero

    // Calculate the external potential at each grid point
    Zip::from(&mut external_potential).and(&electron_density).for_each(|v_ext, &rho| {
        *v_ext = charge / (rho + epsilon);
    });

    // Print the potential at the center of the grid
    println!("External potential at center: {}", external_potential[[50, 50, 50]]);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we create a 3D grid of <code>100x100x100</code> points to represent the electron density using the <code>ndarray</code> crate. The density is initialized with a Gaussian-like distribution to mimic an electron distribution around a central point. This electron density grid can then be used to compute the external potential, which, in this simplified case, is modeled as a Coulomb potential.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, <code>Zip</code> from the <code>ndarray</code> crate is used to efficiently apply a function to each grid point. The external potential is calculated based on the electron density at each point, taking into account a small value (<code>epsilon</code>) to avoid division by zero when the electron density approaches zero. The result is a 3D array representing the external potential, which can be further used in DFT calculations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To represent the electron density using a basis-set approach, we can expand the density in terms of known functions, such as Gaussian or plane wave basis functions. Rustâ€™s ability to handle efficient numerical computation makes it possible to construct and evaluate these basis functions dynamically. Here is an example of how to expand the electron density using Gaussian basis functions:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use nalgebra::DVector;

fn gaussian_basis(r: f64, alpha: f64) -> f64 {
    (-alpha * r.powi(2)).exp()
}

fn main() {
    let alpha = 0.5; // Gaussian width parameter
    let grid_points = 100; // Number of grid points

    // Create a vector to store the electron density
    let mut electron_density = DVector::zeros(grid_points);

    // Calculate electron density using a Gaussian basis function
    for i in 0..grid_points {
        let r = i as f64 / grid_points as f64 * 10.0; // Scaled radial distance
        electron_density[i] = gaussian_basis(r, alpha);
    }

    // Print the electron density at a sample point
    println!("Electron density at r=5.0: {}", electron_density[50]);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the electron density is calculated using a Gaussian basis function with a width parameter <code>alpha</code>. The <code>DVector</code> from the <code>nalgebra</code> crate is used to store the density values, and we loop through the grid points to evaluate the density at each radial distance. This approach mimics the use of basis sets in DFT and can be scaled up to more complex systems by including multiple basis functions or combining them into linear combinations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Numerical methods, such as grid-based or basis-set approaches, are crucial for accurately representing the electron density in DFT calculations. Rustâ€™s ecosystem, with libraries like <code>ndarray</code> and <code>nalgebra</code>, provides efficient tools for implementing these methods. Moreover, Rustâ€™s strong emphasis on safety and concurrency makes it well-suited for the parallelization of these computations, enabling large-scale simulations in computational physics.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems simplify the many-body quantum mechanical problem by establishing the electron density as the central quantity. These theorems form the foundation for DFT and its practical application to real-world systems. Using Rust, we can efficiently model and manipulate electron density and external potential, leveraging numerical methods and libraries to perform high-precision DFT simulations. The code examples provided illustrate how Rust can be used to implement these key concepts in practice.

# 24.3. The Kohn-Sham Equations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Kohn-Sham equations are central to Density Functional Theory (DFT), as they transform the complex many-body problem of interacting electrons into a more tractable system of single-particle equations. The Kohn-Sham approach introduces auxiliary non-interacting particles that reproduce the same electron density as the real, interacting system. These fictitious particles obey single-particle SchrÃ¶dinger-like equations, but the effect of the electron-electron interactions is encapsulated in a term known as the exchange-correlation potential.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In essence, the Kohn-Sham framework allows us to solve for the electron density by solving a set of simpler equations rather than dealing with the many-electron wavefunction directly. The reformulation relies on dividing the total energy functional into several terms: the kinetic energy of the non-interacting particles, the external potential energy, the Hartree (electron-electron Coulomb) energy, and the exchange-correlation energy. The latter, which accounts for quantum mechanical exchange and correlation effects, is the only term that remains unknown and must be approximated.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Kohn-Sham equations are derived by minimizing the total energy functional with respect to the electron density, subject to the constraint that the number of electrons is conserved. This process results in a set of coupled, nonlinear equations that must be solved iteratively because the potential experienced by the electrons depends on their own distribution, leading to the self-consistent field (SCF) method.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The exchange-correlation functional is a critical component in the Kohn-Sham equations, as it accounts for the complex many-body effects of electron exchange and correlation. While the exact form of the exchange-correlation functional is unknown, various approximations, such as the Local Density Approximation (LDA) and the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), are commonly used. These approximations significantly influence the accuracy of DFT calculations, and choosing the appropriate functional is an important step in setting up DFT simulations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To solve the Kohn-Sham equations, the self-consistent field (SCF) method is employed. In the SCF method, the Kohn-Sham equations are solved iteratively: an initial guess for the electron density is made, and the resulting potential is used to solve the equations. The newly obtained electron density is then compared to the previous one, and the process is repeated until the electron density converges, meaning the difference between successive iterations becomes negligible. This iterative process ensures that the potential used in the equations is self-consistent with the electron density.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing the Kohn-Sham equations in Rust involves setting up the SCF loop and handling the exchange-correlation functionals programmatically. Rustâ€™s capabilities for numerical computation and parallel processing make it well-suited for these tasks. Letâ€™s begin by implementing a simplified version of the SCF loop in Rust.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
First, we define the essential components of the Kohn-Sham equations: the kinetic energy operator, the external potential, the Hartree potential, and the exchange-correlation potential. Below is an example of how we can set up the SCF loop and solve the Kohn-Sham equations iteratively.
</p>

            } else if (i as isize - j as isize).abs() == 1 {
                matrix[(i, j)] = -1.0; // Simplified off-diagonal term

    let mut density = DVector::from_element(size, 0.5);

    for iteration in 0..max_iterations {
        // Calculate the exchange-correlation potential
        let v_xc = exchange_correlation_potential(&density);

        // Effective potential = external + exchange-correlation
        let effective_potential = &external_pot + &v_xc;

        // Solve the Kohn-Sham equations (simplified diagonalization)
        let hamiltonian = &kinetic_energy + DMatrix::from_diagonal(&effective_potential);
        let eigen = hamiltonian.svd(true, true).unwrap();

        // Update density (using only the lowest eigenvector for simplicity)
        let new_density = eigen.u.unwrap().column(0).map(|val| val.powi(2));

        // Check for convergence
        if (new_density - &density).norm() < tolerance {
            println!("Converged after {} iterations", iteration);
            return new_density;
        }

        // Update the density for the next iteration
        density = new_density;
    }

    println!("Did not converge after {} iterations", max_iterations);
    density
}

fn main() {
    let size = 10; // Size of the system
    let max_iterations = 100; // Maximum number of SCF iterations

    // Run the SCF loop to solve the Kohn-Sham equations
    let final_density = scf_loop(size, max_iterations, tolerance);

    println!("Final electron density: {:?}", final_density);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, we begin by defining the kinetic energy matrix, which is a simplified version of the kinetic energy operator. The external potential is represented by a constant vector for simplicity, but in real applications, this potential would vary depending on the system being simulated. The exchange-correlation potential is calculated using a simple Local Density Approximation (LDA) functional, which approximates the potential based on the electron density at each point.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The core of the implementation is the SCF loop, which iteratively solves the Kohn-Sham equations. In each iteration, the effective potential is computed as the sum of the external potential and the exchange-correlation potential. The Hamiltonian matrix, which represents the system's total energy, is constructed by adding the kinetic energy matrix to the effective potential. The resulting matrix is diagonalized to obtain the new electron density, which is compared to the previous density to check for convergence.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The convergence criterion is based on the difference between the current and previous electron densities. If the difference is smaller than a predefined tolerance, the SCF loop stops, indicating that the electron density is self-consistent. If convergence is not achieved within the maximum number of iterations, the loop terminates, and a message is printed indicating that the calculation did not converge.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One key challenge in implementing the Kohn-Sham equations is ensuring numerical stability and achieving convergence efficiently. In real-world applications, the SCF loop often requires sophisticated techniques such as mixing schemes to stabilize the iteration process. These techniques average the electron densities between iterations to prevent oscillations or divergence. Rustâ€™s strong type system and memory safety guarantees make it easier to implement these advanced techniques without introducing bugs or memory issues.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Additionally, handling more complex exchange-correlation functionals programmatically in Rust can involve integrating external scientific libraries or implementing more sophisticated numerical algorithms. Rustâ€™s ecosystem includes libraries for numerical linear algebra and scientific computing, which can be used to extend the basic SCF loop to handle larger and more complex systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, the Kohn-Sham equations reformulate the many-body problem into a set of single-particle equations that can be solved iteratively using the SCF method. The role of exchange-correlation functionals is critical for capturing the many-body effects in the system, and the SCF loop ensures that the electron density is self-consistent with the potential. Using Rust, we can efficiently implement these equations, leverage its concurrency features, and ensure safe and robust execution of the SCF loop for DFT calculations. The sample code provided illustrates how the fundamental concepts of the Kohn-Sham equations can be translated into practical Rust implementations for computational physics.

# 24.4. Exchange-Correlation Functionals
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Exchange-correlation functionals are at the heart of Density Functional Theory (DFT) because they encapsulate the complex interactions between electrons that arise from quantum mechanical effects. In DFT, the total energy of a many-electron system is expressed as a functional of the electron density, and the exchange-correlation functional accounts for the effects of both exchange (which arises from the Pauli exclusion principle) and correlation (which accounts for the interactions between electrons due to their mutual repulsion). These functionals are essential to the accuracy of DFT calculations, as they directly influence the computed properties of materials, such as total energy, bond lengths, and electronic structure.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The most widely used exchange-correlation functionals can be categorized into three types: the Local Density Approximation (LDA), the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), and hybrid functionals. LDA assumes that the exchange-correlation energy at a point in space depends only on the electron density at that point, making it computationally efficient but sometimes lacking in accuracy for systems with non-uniform electron distributions. GGA improves upon LDA by incorporating the gradient of the electron density, providing more accurate results for systems with varying densities, such as molecules or surfaces. Hybrid functionals take this a step further by mixing a portion of exact exchange energy (calculated using methods like Hartree-Fock) with a traditional DFT exchange-correlation functional, providing improved accuracy, especially for systems with strong electron correlation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Each type of exchange-correlation functional has its strengths and limitations. LDA is computationally inexpensive and works well for simple, homogeneous systems like bulk metals, where the electron density is relatively uniform. However, its limitations become apparent in more complex systems, such as molecules or surfaces, where electron density variations are significant. In such cases, LDA often underestimates important quantities, such as bond lengths and reaction barriers.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
GGA, such as the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, offers improved accuracy by accounting for the spatial variations in electron density. This makes GGA more suitable for systems with complex geometries, such as molecules and solids with surface effects. Despite its improvements, GGA can still struggle with systems that exhibit strong electron correlation, leading to errors in the predicted properties.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hybrid functionals, such as B3LYP, introduce a mix of exact exchange energy, which corrects some of the deficiencies of LDA and GGA. This added accuracy makes hybrid functionals particularly useful for molecular systems and transition states, where electron exchange and correlation effects are more pronounced. However, hybrid functionals are computationally more expensive because the calculation of exact exchange involves evaluating electron-electron integrals, which scales poorly with system size.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The choice of exchange-correlation functional in DFT calculations is a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. While LDA is fast, it may lack accuracy for complex systems. GGA improves accuracy at a moderate increase in computational cost, and hybrid functionals provide the highest accuracy but at a significant computational expense. The challenge in DFT lies in selecting the appropriate functional based on the system being studied and the desired accuracy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, implementing exchange-correlation functionals involves defining the mathematical formulations for each type of functional and applying them to the electron density during DFT calculations. Letâ€™s begin by implementing the Local Density Approximation (LDA) in Rust. The LDA functional depends only on the local value of the electron density and can be expressed as a simple power law for both exchange and correlation energy contributions. Below is a sample implementation of LDA in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use nalgebra::DVector;

// Local Density Approximation (LDA) exchange functional
fn lda_exchange(density: &DVector<f64>) -> DVector<f64> {
    let factor = -0.75 * (3.0 / std::f64::consts::PI).powf(1.0 / 3.0);
    density.map(|rho| factor * rho.powf(1.0 / 3.0))
}

// Local Density Approximation (LDA) correlation functional (simple parametrization)
fn lda_correlation(density: &DVector<f64>) -> DVector<f64> {
    density.map(|rho| -0.44 * rho.ln()) // Simplified correlation functional
}

fn main() {
    // Example electron density (uniform distribution)
    let density = DVector::from_vec(vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]);

    // Compute LDA exchange and correlation potentials
    let v_x = lda_exchange(&density);
    let v_c = lda_correlation(&density);

    // Print results
    println!("LDA Exchange Potential: {:?}", v_x);
    println!("LDA Correlation Potential: {:?}", v_c);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we first define the LDA exchange functional, which scales with the electron density to the power of $1/3$. The exchange functional is based on a known analytical expression derived from the homogeneous electron gas model. Similarly, we define the LDA correlation functional, which is a simple logarithmic function of the density. These functions take the electron density as input and return the corresponding exchange and correlation potentials.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>DVector</code> type from the <code>nalgebra</code> crate is used to store the electron density and apply the functional element-wise. This allows us to efficiently compute the exchange-correlation potential for each point in the system. While this example uses a uniform electron density for simplicity, in real DFT calculations, the electron density would be dynamically updated during the SCF loop, and these functionals would be applied at each iteration.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For a more accurate treatment of complex systems, the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) can be implemented. GGA functionals depend not only on the local electron density but also on the gradient of the density. Here is an example of how to implement a simple GGA functional in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use nalgebra::DVector;

// Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) exchange functional (simplified)
fn gga_exchange(density: &DVector<f64>, gradient: &DVector<f64>) -> DVector<f64> {
    let factor = -0.75 * (3.0 / std::f64::consts::PI).powf(1.0 / 3.0);
    density.zip_map(gradient, |rho, grad_rho| factor * rho.powf(1.0 / 3.0) * (1.0 + 0.2 * grad_rho))
}

// Gradient of electron density (simplified numerical derivative)
fn density_gradient(density: &DVector<f64>) -> DVector<f64> {
    let mut gradient = DVector::zeros(density.len());
    for i in 1..density.len() - 1 {
        gradient[i] = (density[i + 1] - density[i - 1]) / 2.0; // Central difference
    }
    gradient
}

fn main() {
    // Example electron density
    let density = DVector::from_vec(vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]);

    // Compute the gradient of the electron density
    let gradient = density_gradient(&density);

    // Compute GGA exchange potential
    let v_x_gga = gga_exchange(&density, &gradient);

    // Print results
    println!("GGA Exchange Potential: {:?}", v_x_gga);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this GGA implementation, we calculate the gradient of the electron density using a simple finite difference method. The GGA exchange functional is then computed as a modification of the LDA exchange, with an additional term that depends on the gradient of the density. This captures the variations in electron density more accurately than LDA, especially in systems where the density is non-uniform.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the challenges in implementing GGA functionals is calculating the gradient of the electron density efficiently. In this example, we used a simple central difference method, but more sophisticated numerical methods may be needed for larger and more complex systems to achieve better accuracy and convergence.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hybrid functionals, which mix exact exchange from Hartree-Fock with DFT exchange-correlation functionals, require even more computational effort due to the need to evaluate electron-electron integrals. While Rustâ€™s performance and concurrency features can be leveraged for this purpose, hybrid functionals are generally more computationally intensive than LDA or GGA.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust-based DFT implementations, it is important to compare the performance of different exchange-correlation functionals in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. LDA functionals are computationally cheaper, making them suitable for large-scale systems where computational cost is a concern. GGA functionals, while more accurate for systems with complex electron distributions, come with increased computational cost due to the need for gradient evaluations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To benchmark these functionals in Rust, one can profile the execution time of DFT simulations using different functionals and compare their accuracy against experimental data or more sophisticated methods. Rustâ€™s performance-oriented features, such as zero-cost abstractions and concurrency via <code>rayon</code>, can be used to parallelize the computation of exchange-correlation potentials, further optimizing the performance for large systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, exchange-correlation functionals play a crucial role in the accuracy of DFT calculations, with each type offering different trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost. Implementing these functionals in Rust involves defining their mathematical formulations and integrating them into the SCF loop for DFT simulations. Rustâ€™s strong performance capabilities, combined with its concurrency features, make it well-suited for handling the computational challenges posed by exchange-correlation functionals, particularly for large and complex systems. The provided sample codes illustrate the implementation of LDA and GGA functionals in Rust, offering a practical foundation for expanding these methods in larger DFT simulations.
</p>

# 24.5. Numerical Methods in DFT
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Numerical methods play a pivotal role in Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, enabling the accurate and efficient solution of complex quantum mechanical problems. One of the primary decisions when implementing DFT is selecting an appropriate basis set to represent the electron density and wavefunctions. Common choices include plane waves, which are well-suited for periodic systems like crystals, and atomic orbitals, which are often more appropriate for molecular systems. The choice of basis set influences both the accuracy and computational cost of DFT calculations. Plane waves offer systematic convergence but require a large number of basis functions to describe localized features like core electrons. On the other hand, atomic orbitals can be more efficient for localized systems but may lack flexibility in highly delocalized systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another critical component of DFT is the numerical integration of the total energy functional and the solution of Poissonâ€™s equation, which is used to compute the electrostatic potential. In electrostatic problems, Poissonâ€™s equation relates the electron density to the potential, and solving it efficiently is crucial for the self-consistent field (SCF) loop. Numerical methods like finite difference methods or spectral methods are commonly employed to solve Poissonâ€™s equation, and selecting the appropriate method depends on the system's geometry and boundary conditions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Grid-based methods are one of the most common numerical approaches used in DFT calculations, particularly for systems where the electron density can vary significantly across space. These methods discretize the spatial domain into a grid and solve the equations at each grid point. This approach is particularly useful for solving Poissonâ€™s equation in three dimensions. The accuracy of grid-based methods depends on the resolution of the grid, with finer grids providing more accurate results but increasing computational cost and memory requirements. The trade-off between grid resolution and computational efficiency must be considered carefully, especially in large-scale simulations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the context of solving Poissonâ€™s equation, numerical methods such as finite difference methods can be employed to discretize the second-order partial differential equation. In three-dimensional space, this typically results in a large sparse matrix that can be solved using iterative methods like the conjugate gradient method or direct solvers such as LU decomposition. Efficient memory management and parallelization are key challenges when solving Poissonâ€™s equation for large systems in DFT.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing numerical methods for DFT in Rust requires careful attention to both performance and memory management. Rustâ€™s emphasis on safety and its ownership model make it well-suited for managing memory efficiently in large-scale simulations. To implement grid-based methods, we can use multi-dimensional arrays to represent the grid points, and numerical differentiation can be employed to approximate the derivatives required for solving Poissonâ€™s equation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s begin by implementing a basic grid-based method for solving Poissonâ€™s equation using the finite difference method. In this example, we will discretize the Laplace operator in three dimensions and solve the resulting system using an iterative solver.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, we use a 3D grid to represent the electron density and solve Poissonâ€™s equation using the Jacobi iteration method, which is an iterative approach for solving linear systems. The Laplacian operator is discretized using the finite difference method, where each grid point is updated based on the values of its neighbors. The electron density is initialized using a Gaussian distribution as an example. The solution to Poissonâ€™s equation is the electrostatic potential, which is iteratively updated until convergence is reached or a maximum number of iterations is exceeded.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>Array3</code> type from the <code>ndarray</code> crate is used to represent the 3D grid. By leveraging Rustâ€™s <code>Zip</code> function, we can efficiently apply operations over the grid points in parallel, if needed. In large-scale DFT calculations, this parallelization is critical for handling large systems efficiently. The Jacobi method is simple but can be extended to more advanced solvers such as the conjugate gradient method for improved performance and convergence properties.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To optimize performance further, Rustâ€™s <code>rayon</code> crate can be used to parallelize the loop over grid points. By distributing the workload across multiple threads, we can significantly reduce the runtime for large systems. Hereâ€™s an example of how to parallelize the solution of Poissonâ€™s equation using <code>rayon</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rayon::prelude::*;
use ndarray::{Array3, Zip};

// Parallelized Poisson solver using Rayon
fn solve_poisson_parallel(density: &Array3<f64>, max_iter: usize, tol: f64) -> Array3<f64> {
    let size = density.len_of(ndarray::Axis(0));
    let mut potential = Array3::<f64>::zeros((size, size, size));
    let mut new_potential = potential.clone();

    for _ in 0..max_iter {
        new_potential.par_iter_mut().enumerate().for_each(|(idx, v)| {
            let (i, j, k) = (idx / (size * size), (idx / size) % size, idx % size);
            if i > 0 && i < size - 1 && j > 0 && j < size - 1 && k > 0 && k < size - 1 {
                *v = 0.25
                    * (potential[[i + 1, j, k]]
                        + potential[[i - 1, j, k]]
                        + potential[[i, j + 1, k]]
                        + potential[[i, j - 1, k]]
                        + potential[[i, j, k + 1]]
                        + potential[[i, j, k - 1]]
                        - density[[i, j, k]] / (4.0 * std::f64::consts::PI));
            }
        });

        // Check for convergence
        if (&new_potential - &potential).iter().map(|&x| x.abs()).sum::<f64>() < tol {
            println!("Converged.");
            return new_potential;
        }

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this parallelized version, we replace the regular iteration with <code>par_iter_mut</code> from the <code>rayon</code> crate, which allows us to process each grid point in parallel. The implementation remains conceptually the same, but it takes advantage of multi-core processors to handle larger systems or more complex grids faster.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Efficient memory management is crucial in large-scale DFT simulations, particularly when working with large grids or basis sets. Rustâ€™s ownership model ensures that memory is managed safely, preventing common issues like memory leaks or dangling pointers. Additionally, Rustâ€™s <code>ndarray</code> crate allows for efficient in-place operations, reducing memory overhead during numerical calculations. When solving large linear systems like Poissonâ€™s equation, care must be taken to minimize unnecessary memory allocations by reusing data structures and taking advantage of Rustâ€™s mutable borrowing system to modify arrays in place.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, numerical methods such as grid-based approaches and solving Poissonâ€™s equation are essential for DFT simulations. In Rust, these methods can be implemented efficiently using multi-dimensional arrays and optimized using parallel computing techniques. The provided sample codes demonstrate how to solve Poissonâ€™s equation using both sequential and parallelized approaches in Rust, highlighting the languageâ€™s strengths in performance and memory management. This makes Rust an excellent choice for implementing large-scale DFT calculations that require both accuracy and computational efficiency.

# 24.6. Self-Consistent Field (SCF) Method
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Self-Consistent Field (SCF) method is a critical part of solving the Kohn-Sham equations in Density Functional Theory (DFT). The Kohn-Sham equations are nonlinear because the potential in which electrons move depends on the electron density itself. The SCF method addresses this nonlinearity through an iterative process. Starting with an initial guess for the electron density, the Kohn-Sham equations are solved to produce a new electron density. This new density is then used to update the potential, and the equations are solved again. The process is repeated until the electron density converges to a self-consistent solution, meaning that the input density used to calculate the potential produces the same density as output from the Kohn-Sham equations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Achieving self-consistency is crucial in DFT calculations because the results, such as total energy, are only meaningful once the electron density and potential are consistent. The convergence criteria are typically based on either the change in total energy between iterations or the change in electron density. A common convergence threshold is when these changes become smaller than a predefined tolerance, indicating that the system has reached a stable configuration. Convergence is necessary to ensure that the physical properties predicted by DFT are accurate and reliable.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the key challenges in the SCF method is achieving convergence, particularly for complex systems where the electron density may change drastically between iterations. Mixing schemes are commonly employed to accelerate convergence and prevent oscillations. Instead of using the new density or potential directly in each iteration, a weighted average of the new and previous densities (or potentials) is taken. This helps dampen oscillations and stabilize the iterative process.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
There are several types of mixing schemes. The simplest is linear mixing, where a fixed proportion of the new density is mixed with the old density. This is computationally inexpensive but may converge slowly. More advanced schemes include Anderson mixing, which dynamically adjusts the mixing parameters to improve convergence. Another approach is Broyden mixing, which uses the history of previous iterations to predict future densities, often leading to faster convergence.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Common challenges in SCF calculations include slow convergence, oscillatory behavior, and the possibility of divergence, where the electron density fails to stabilize. These issues often arise in systems with near-degenerate states or where the initial guess for the electron density is far from the true solution. Strategies to overcome these challenges include using more sophisticated mixing schemes, increasing the accuracy of the initial guess, or preconditioning the system to make convergence more likely.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing the SCF method in Rust involves setting up the iterative loop, applying mixing schemes, and checking for convergence. Rust's performance characteristics, such as its ability to handle concurrent computations and its memory safety features, make it an excellent choice for implementing SCF calculations efficiently. Below is an implementation of a simplified SCF loop with linear mixing in Rust.

    println!("Final electron density: {:?}", final_density);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, we begin by defining a function to compute the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian based on the electron density. The Hamiltonian is simplified here, with diagonal terms determined by the density and off-diagonal terms representing hopping between orbitals. The <code>update_density</code> function takes the lowest eigenvector (representing the ground state) and computes the electron density as the square of its entries.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The core of the SCF method is the <code>scf_loop</code>, which performs the iterative updates. In each iteration, we compute the Hamiltonian, solve for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and update the density. Linear mixing is applied by combining the new and old densities based on a mixing parameter. The loop checks for convergence by comparing the difference between the new and old densities, and if the change is below a predefined tolerance, the loop exits, indicating that self-consistency has been achieved.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This basic implementation of the SCF method can be extended to include more sophisticated mixing schemes. For example, we can implement Anderson mixing, which dynamically adjusts the mixing parameter based on previous iterations. Here is an example of how Anderson mixing could be implemented in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn anderson_mixing(density: &DVector<f64>, old_density: &DVector<f64>, residual: &DVector<f64>, beta: f64) -> DVector<f64> {
    old_density + residual * beta // Anderson mixing: adjust density using residual and mixing factor
}

fn scf_loop_anderson(size: usize, max_iterations: usize, tol: f64, beta: f64) -> DVector<f64> {
    let mut density = DVector::from_element(size, 1.0); // Initial guess
    let mut old_density = density.clone();
    
    for iteration in 0..max_iterations {
        let hamiltonian = compute_hamiltonian(&density, size);
        let eigen = hamiltonian.svd(true, true).unwrap();
        let new_density = update_density(&eigen.u.unwrap().column(0));

        // Calculate residual (difference between new and old densities)
        let residual = &new_density - &density;

        // Apply Anderson mixing
        density = anderson_mixing(&density, &old_density, &residual, beta);

        // Check for convergence
        if residual.norm() < tol {
            println!("Converged after {} iterations with Anderson mixing", iteration);
            return density;
        }

        old_density = density.clone();
    }

    println!("SCF did not converge after {} iterations with Anderson mixing", max_iterations);
    density
}

fn main() {
    let size = 10; // Size of the system (number of orbitals)
    let max_iterations = 100; // Maximum SCF iterations
    let tol = 1e-6; // Convergence tolerance
    let beta = 0.7; // Anderson mixing parameter

    // Run the SCF loop with Anderson mixing
    let final_density = scf_loop_anderson(size, max_iterations, tol, beta);

    println!("Final electron density with Anderson mixing: {:?}", final_density);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this version, Anderson mixing is applied by using the residual (the difference between the new and old densities) to adjust the density. The residual is scaled by a mixing factor <code>beta</code>, which controls how much of the residual is added to the current density. Anderson mixing generally accelerates convergence compared to linear mixing, especially for systems with slow convergence.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Achieving convergence in SCF calculations can be challenging, particularly for systems with near-degenerate states or poor initial guesses for the electron density. Strategies to improve convergence include:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Preconditioning: Modifying the electron density or potential before starting the SCF loop to bring the system closer to the true solution.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Variable Mixing: Adjusting the mixing parameter dynamically during the SCF iterations. Larger values can be used early on to accelerate convergence, while smaller values may help refine the solution in later iterations.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Improved Initial Guess: Starting with an initial electron density that is closer to the final self-consistent density can significantly reduce the number of iterations needed for convergence. For example, using a density from a previous calculation or from a similar system can help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, the Self-Consistent Field (SCF) method is essential for solving the Kohn-Sham equations in DFT. Convergence is crucial for obtaining accurate physical properties, and mixing schemes are a key tool for accelerating the iterative process. Using Rust, the SCF method can be implemented efficiently, with robust handling of different mixing schemes and convergence checks. The provided examples demonstrate the implementation of both linear and Anderson mixing in Rust, illustrating how SCF calculations can be performed effectively in computational physics applications.

# 24.7. Implementing DFT in Rust: A Step-by-Step Guide
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing a full Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation from scratch involves multiple stages, from setting up the system and initializing the electron density to solving the Kohn-Sham equations and analyzing the results. A well-structured DFT implementation requires a modular design where each component of the calculation is isolated and interacts efficiently with others. The key stages in a DFT workflow include:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">System setup and initialization, where the physical system (e.g., a molecule or crystal) is defined, and an initial guess for the electron density is made.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Numerical methods for solving equations, such as Poissonâ€™s equation for electrostatics or solving the Kohn-Sham equations.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">The self-consistent field (SCF) loop, which iteratively updates the electron density until self-consistency is achieved.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Analysis of the results, including calculating properties such as total energy, electron density distribution, and molecular orbitals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, each of these stages should be implemented as modular components to ensure that the code is reusable, maintainable, and optimized for performance. Rustâ€™s strong type system and memory management features enable the creation of efficient and safe scientific software, while its ecosystem provides tools for parallelization and numerical computation, which are essential for DFT.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The workflow of a DFT calculation typically follows these steps:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">System Setup and Initialization: At the beginning of the process, we define the system, which includes specifying the atoms, the grid or basis set, and the initial guess for the electron density. This might involve reading from an input file, defining the atomic positions, and initializing the electron density as a simple Gaussian distribution or a superposition of atomic densities.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Numerical Methods: Next, we set up the numerical methods required to solve the Kohn-Sham equations. This includes setting up the Hamiltonian matrix, calculating the exchange-correlation potential, and solving Poissonâ€™s equation for the electrostatic potential. These methods must be efficient and scalable to handle large systems.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Self-Consistent Field (SCF) Loop: The SCF loop iteratively solves the Kohn-Sham equations and updates the electron density until convergence is reached. Mixing schemes are often used to stabilize this process, and convergence criteria are checked after each iteration.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Results Analysis: Once the electron density has converged, the final results are analyzed. This includes calculating the total energy, electron density distribution, and derived properties such as molecular orbitals or band structure in periodic systems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Each of these components interacts with the others. For example, the electron density calculated in one SCF iteration is used to update the Hamiltonian in the next iteration, and the convergence check is based on the difference in densities between iterations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s walk through the step-by-step implementation of a DFT code in Rust. We will focus on modularity and code structure to ensure each part of the DFT workflow is isolated and easy to maintain. Below is an overview of how to implement each stage, with Rust code examples integrated into the explanation.
</p>

#### **Step 1:** System Setup and Initialization
<p style="text-align: justify;">
First, we define a struct to represent the system. This struct will hold information about the atoms, grid, and initial electron density. We can then initialize the electron density as a Gaussian distribution for simplicity.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use ndarray::{Array3, Zip};

// Struct representing the physical system
struct System {
    grid_size: usize,
    electron_density: Array3<f64>, // 3D grid representing electron density
}

// Function to initialize the electron density (e.g., Gaussian distribution)
impl System {
    fn initialize(grid_size: usize) -> Self {
        let mut electron_density = Array3::<f64>::zeros((grid_size, grid_size, grid_size));
        let center = grid_size as f64 / 2.0;

        for i in 0..grid_size {
            for j in 0..grid_size {
                for k in 0..grid_size {
                    let r_squared = (i as f64 - center).powi(2)
                        + (j as f64 - center).powi(2)
                        + (k as f64 - center).powi(2);
                    electron_density[[i, j, k]] = (-r_squared / 50.0).exp();
                }
            }
        }

        Self { grid_size, electron_density }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let grid_size = 50; // Grid size
    let system = System::initialize(grid_size);
    
    // Print a sample value from the initialized electron density
    println!("Initial electron density at center: {}", system.electron_density[[grid_size / 2, grid_size / 2, grid_size / 2]]);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, we define the <code>System</code> struct, which includes the grid size and a 3D array for the electron density. The <code>initialize</code> method fills the electron density array with values based on a Gaussian distribution, which serves as an initial guess.
</p>

#### **Step 2:** Numerical Methods
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Next, we implement the numerical methods required to solve Poissonâ€™s equation and calculate the exchange-correlation potential. Weâ€™ll use finite difference methods for Poissonâ€™s equation and a simple Local Density Approximation (LDA) for the exchange-correlation potential.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Function to solve Poisson's equation using finite difference method
fn solve_poisson(density: &Array3<f64>, grid_size: usize, max_iter: usize, tol: f64) -> Array3<f64> {
    let mut potential = Array3::<f64>::zeros((grid_size, grid_size, grid_size));
    let mut new_potential = potential.clone();

    for _ in 0..max_iter {
        Zip::indexed(&mut new_potential).for_each(|(i, j, k), v| {
            if i > 0 && i < grid_size - 1 && j > 0 && j < grid_size - 1 && k > 0 && k < grid_size - 1 {
                *v = 0.25
                    * (potential[[i + 1, j, k]]
                        + potential[[i - 1, j, k]]
                        + potential[[i, j + 1, k]]
                        + potential[[i, j - 1, k]]
                        + potential[[i, j, k + 1]]
                        + potential[[i, j, k - 1]]
                        - density[[i, j, k]] / (4.0 * std::f64::consts::PI));
            }
        });

        if (&new_potential - &potential).iter().map(|&x| x.abs()).sum::<f64>() < tol {
            break;
        }

        potential.assign(&new_potential);
    }

    new_potential
}

// Simple LDA exchange-correlation functional
fn lda_exchange_correlation(density: &Array3<f64>) -> Array3<f64> {
    density.map(|rho| -0.75 * (3.0 / std::f64::consts::PI).powf(1.0 / 3.0) * rho.powf(1.0 / 3.0))
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we implement the Poisson solver using the finite difference method to compute the electrostatic potential. We also define the LDA exchange-correlation functional, which calculates the exchange-correlation potential based on the electron density.
</p>

#### **Step 3:** Self-Consistent Field (SCF) Loop
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The SCF loop is the heart of the DFT implementation. Here, we solve the Kohn-Sham equations iteratively, updating the electron density until convergence is achieved.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn scf_loop(system: &mut System, max_iter: usize, tol: f64, mixing_param: f64) {
    let mut old_density = system.electron_density.clone();

    for iteration in 0..max_iter {
        // Solve Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential
        let potential = solve_poisson(&system.electron_density, system.grid_size, 100, tol);

        // Compute exchange-correlation potential
        let v_xc = lda_exchange_correlation(&system.electron_density);

        // Update Hamiltonian and solve for new electron density (simplified)
        // In a real implementation, we would compute eigenvalues/eigenvectors here
        let new_density = &potential + &v_xc; // Simplified update for demo purposes

        // Mixing scheme: linear mixing
        system.electron_density = &old_density * (1.0 - mixing_param) + &new_density * mixing_param;

        // Check for convergence
        let diff = (&system.electron_density - &old_density).iter().map(|&x| x.abs()).sum::<f64>();
        if diff < tol {
            println!("SCF converged after {} iterations", iteration);
            return;
        }

        // Update old density for next iteration
        old_density = system.electron_density.clone();
    }

    println!("SCF did not converge after {} iterations", max_iter);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the SCF loop, we first solve Poissonâ€™s equation to compute the electrostatic potential, then calculate the exchange-correlation potential using the LDA functional. The electron density is updated based on these potentials, and linear mixing is applied to stabilize the iterative process. Convergence is checked after each iteration by comparing the new and old electron densities.
</p>

#### **Step 4:** Results Analysis
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Once the SCF loop converges, we can extract useful information from the results, such as the total energy or electron density distribution. For example, we can print the final electron density or compute derived quantities like molecular orbitals.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let grid_size = 50;
    let max_iter = 100;
    let tol = 1e-6;
    let mixing_param = 0.5;

    let mut system = System::initialize(grid_size);

    // Run the SCF loop
    scf_loop(&mut system, max_iter, tol, mixing_param);

    // Print final electron density at center
    println!("Final electron density at center: {}", system.electron_density[[grid_size / 2, grid_size / 2, grid_size / 2]]);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this final step, we run the SCF loop and print the final electron density after the calculation has converged. In a more complete DFT implementation, we would also compute properties such as total energy, forces on atoms, or band structure.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Practical Tips for Optimization:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Modularity: Ensure each component (system setup, numerical methods, SCF loop) is modular to allow for easier debugging, testing, and future improvements.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Parallelization: Use Rustâ€™s <code>rayon</code> crate for parallelizing the SCF loop or Poisson solver to speed up large-scale DFT calculations.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Memory Management: Take advantage of Rustâ€™s ownership and borrowing model to manage large arrays efficiently and prevent unnecessary memory allocations.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Debugging: Rustâ€™s compile-time checks and error messages are valuable for debugging issues related to memory safety and array bounds, making it easier to track down issues in large DFT codebases.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, implementing DFT in Rust involves building a structured and modular program that integrates the SCF method, numerical solvers, and exchange-correlation functionals. Rustâ€™s features make it well-suited for this type of scientific computing, ensuring both high performance and safety. The sample code provided offers a foundation for building more advanced DFT implementations in Rust, with a focus on modularity and optimization.

# 24.8. Parallelization and High-Performance Computing in DFT
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Parallel computing is critical to scaling Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to larger systems and more complex materials. DFT simulations often involve the solution of large linear systems, the computation of electron densities across vast grids, and the iterative self-consistent field (SCF) method. As system size increases, so does the computational cost, making it essential to leverage parallel computing and high-performance computing (HPC) techniques.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
High-performance computing allows for the decomposition of DFT calculations into smaller, parallelizable tasks, enabling the efficient use of multiple processors and cores. This approach significantly reduces computation time for large systems and enables simulations of materials with complex electronic structures, such as biomolecules, nanomaterials, and condensed matter systems. HPC environments often rely on strategies such as domain decomposition (dividing the computational grid or space into smaller subdomains) and data parallelism (distributing data across multiple processors). These techniques, combined with efficient memory management, allow DFT simulations to scale efficiently on modern multi-core and distributed systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the context of DFT, several parallelization strategies can be employed:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Domain Decomposition: The simulation domain (e.g., the electron density grid) is divided into smaller subdomains, each handled by a separate processor. This method is well-suited for grid-based methods in DFT, where each subdomain can be processed independently before being combined into the final solution. For instance, Poissonâ€™s equation, which governs the electrostatic potential, can be solved in parallel by decomposing the spatial grid into smaller chunks and solving them simultaneously.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Data Parallelism: Data parallelism involves distributing different parts of the data, such as matrix elements or grid points, across multiple processors. This is particularly useful for tasks like matrix operations (e.g., matrix diagonalization) or evaluating the electron density at each point in space. In Rust, this type of parallelism can be efficiently implemented using the <code>rayon</code> crate, which simplifies multi-threaded parallel execution.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Task Parallelism: Task parallelism assigns different parts of the computational workload to different processors. For example, in a DFT calculation, one processor may handle solving the Kohn-Sham equations while another processes the exchange-correlation functional calculations. Task parallelism can be effectively combined with data parallelism to further optimize performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s concurrency model, combined with external libraries like <code>rayon</code> and <code>tokio</code>, provides powerful tools for implementing these parallelization strategies in a safe and efficient way. Rustâ€™s strict memory management ensures that data races are prevented, making it easier to develop reliable parallel DFT codes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s look at practical implementations of parallel DFT simulations in Rust, focusing on parallelizing different components of the calculation using Rustâ€™s concurrency features.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In a DFT calculation, solving Poissonâ€™s equation is a critical step in determining the electrostatic potential. Using domain decomposition, we can divide the 3D grid into smaller subdomains and solve each one in parallel. Rustâ€™s <code>rayon</code> crate allows us to easily parallelize the computation over different sections of the grid.
</p>

    let mut new_potential = potential.clone();

    for _ in 0..max_iter {
        new_potential.par_iter_mut().enumerate().for_each(|(index, v)| {
            let i = index / (grid_size * grid_size);

            }
        });

    // Print the potential at the center of the grid

{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we parallelize the computation of the electrostatic potential over a 3D grid using Rust's <code>rayon</code> crate. The grid is split across different threads, with each thread solving for a portion of the grid independently. The results are then combined, and a convergence check is performed across all grid points. This approach is ideal for large-scale DFT calculations where solving Poissonâ€™s equation can be a computational bottleneck.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The SCF loop can also be parallelized to improve performance, especially when evaluating the Hamiltonian matrix or calculating the exchange-correlation potential. In this case, we can parallelize matrix operations and electron density updates using <code>rayon</code>.

{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this SCF loop implementation, we parallelize the Hamiltonian matrix construction using <code>rayon</code>. Each element of the Hamiltonian is calculated in parallel, reducing the computational time, especially for large systems. After constructing the Hamiltonian, we solve the simplified eigenvalue problem to update the electron density. Parallelization at this stage allows the SCF loop to handle larger systems with increased efficiency.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Optimizing Rust-based DFT codes for high-performance computing environments requires a few key considerations:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Memory Management: Efficient memory usage is crucial for large-scale DFT simulations. Rustâ€™s ownership model and strict borrowing rules help prevent memory leaks and ensure efficient memory allocation. However, when dealing with large matrices or grids, careful management of memory allocation and reuse is essential to avoid unnecessary overhead.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Parallelization Granularity: It's important to ensure that tasks being parallelized are large enough to justify the overhead of parallelization. For example, parallelizing very small matrix operations may result in diminishing returns due to the overhead of managing threads. Profiling the code using tools like <code>cargo flamegraph</code> can help identify where parallelism would be most effective.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Task Scheduling: For complex DFT simulations that involve multiple types of operations (e.g., matrix operations, solving differential equations, SCF iterations), task parallelism can be used to distribute different tasks across processors. Libraries such as <code>tokio</code> can be used for more advanced scheduling and concurrency control.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Distributed Computing: Rust-based DFT codes can be extended to run on distributed systems by using libraries like <code>mpi-rs</code> for message-passing between nodes. This enables DFT simulations to scale beyond the limitations of a single machine by distributing the workload across multiple machines in a high-performance cluster.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Parallelization and high-performance computing are essential for scaling DFT simulations to handle larger and more complex systems. Rustâ€™s concurrency features and external libraries like <code>rayon</code> provide the tools necessary to implement parallel DFT calculations efficiently. By parallelizing components such as the Poisson solver and the SCF loop, Rust-based DFT codes can be optimized for large-scale simulations on multi-core and distributed computing environments. The examples provided demonstrate how to implement domain decomposition, data parallelism, and matrix operations in parallel, paving the way for more advanced and scalable DFT implementations in Rust.

# 24.9. Case Studies: Applications of DFT
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Density Functional Theory (DFT) is widely used in real-world applications across various fields such as materials science, chemistry, and nanotechnology. DFT enables scientists to investigate and predict the properties of materials and molecules by solving quantum mechanical equations that govern the behavior of electrons. Its ability to model complex systems with relatively low computational cost compared to other quantum mechanical methods makes DFT a powerful tool for understanding key properties like electronic structure, band gaps, reaction mechanisms, and material stability.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In materials science, DFT is commonly used to calculate the electronic structure and predict properties such as conductivity, magnetism, and optical behavior. In chemistry, DFT is used to explore reaction mechanisms, transition states, and the interaction between molecules. It also plays a vital role in nanotechnology, where it helps design new nanomaterials with desired properties by providing insights into their atomic-level behavior. The application of DFT to these areas provides researchers with the ability to simulate experiments that would otherwise be costly or difficult to perform in a laboratory.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Several case studies illustrate the use of DFT to solve practical problems. For instance, DFT can be used to calculate the band structure of semiconductors and insulators, which is critical for designing electronic devices. By solving the Kohn-Sham equations for a material, researchers can determine the materialâ€™s band gap, helping identify potential candidates for use in transistors or solar cells.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another common application is studying reaction mechanisms in chemistry. DFT is employed to map out potential energy surfaces and identify the energy barriers associated with chemical reactions. This provides insights into the reaction pathways, which can help in designing more efficient catalysts. For example, DFT simulations of transition metal catalysts in industrial processes allow for a deeper understanding of the interactions at the atomic level, leading to the optimization of catalytic activity.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In nanotechnology, DFT has been used to investigate the stability of new nanomaterials like graphene, nanowires, or quantum dots. By simulating the arrangement of atoms and calculating the resulting electronic and mechanical properties, researchers can predict the behavior of these materials under various conditions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s now walk through a practical case study in Rust. We will implement a DFT-based approach to calculate the band structure of a simple material (e.g., graphene) and analyze the electronic properties. This example will demonstrate how DFT is applied in real-world scenarios and how the computational results can be interpreted.
</p>

### **Case Study:** Band Structure Calculation of Graphene
#### **Step 1:** Setting Up the System
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Graphene is a two-dimensional material composed of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. Its unique electronic properties, such as its zero band gap and high electrical conductivity, make it an excellent candidate for DFT studies. We begin by defining the atomic structure and initializing the electron density.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use ndarray::Array2;

// Struct representing the 2D lattice of graphene
struct GrapheneLattice {
    num_atoms: usize,
    lattice_vectors: Array2<f64>,
}

// Function to initialize graphene lattice
impl GrapheneLattice {
    fn new() -> Self {
        // Hexagonal lattice vectors for graphene
        let lattice_vectors = array![
            [1.0, 0.0],
            [0.5, 0.866]
        ];

        Self {
            num_atoms: 2, // Each unit cell has two carbon atoms
            lattice_vectors,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Initialize the graphene lattice
    let graphene = GrapheneLattice::new();
    println!("Graphene lattice initialized with {} atoms per unit cell.", graphene.num_atoms);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, we initialize the graphene lattice with two atoms per unit cell. The lattice vectors define the periodicity of the material. This setup represents the atomic structure of graphene and forms the basis for calculating the electronic properties.
</p>

#### **Step 2:** Hamiltonian Matrix and Kohn-Sham Equations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
We now set up the Hamiltonian matrix based on the tight-binding model to approximate the interactions between carbon atoms. The Hamiltonian describes the energy of electrons moving through the graphene lattice, and solving the Kohn-Sham equations will give us the eigenvalues (energies) and eigenvectors (wavefunctions) corresponding to different electron states.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use nalgebra::{DMatrix, DVector};

// Function to build the tight-binding Hamiltonian matrix for graphene
fn build_hamiltonian(kx: f64, ky: f64) -> DMatrix<f64> {
    let t = -2.7; // Nearest-neighbor hopping energy in eV (typical for graphene)
    let mut hamiltonian = DMatrix::zeros(2, 2);

    // Hamiltonian elements based on nearest-neighbor interactions
    hamiltonian[(0, 1)] = t * (1.0 + f64::exp(1.0 * kx) + f64::exp(1.0 * ky));
    hamiltonian[(1, 0)] = hamiltonian[(0, 1)]; // Hermitian property

    hamiltonian
}

// Function to calculate the band structure (energies)
fn calculate_band_structure(k_points: &Vec<(f64, f64)>) -> Vec<f64> {
    let mut energies = Vec::new();
    for &(kx, ky) in k_points {
        let hamiltonian = build_hamiltonian(kx, ky);
        let eigenvalues = hamiltonian.svd(true, true).unwrap().singular_values;
        energies.push(eigenvalues[0]); // Take the lowest energy eigenvalue
    }
    energies
}

fn main() {
    // Define a path through the Brillouin zone (k-space) for graphene
    let k_points = vec![
        (0.0, 0.0), (0.5, 0.0), (0.5, 0.5), (0.0, 0.5) // Simplified for example
    ];

    // Calculate the band structure
    let band_structure = calculate_band_structure(&k_points);

    // Print the energies (band structure)
    for (i, energy) in band_structure.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("k-point {}: Energy = {:.3} eV", i, energy);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this step, we construct the Hamiltonian matrix based on the nearest-neighbor hopping energy of graphene, using a tight-binding model. The matrix is then diagonalized to obtain the eigenvalues, which represent the energy of electrons at each k-point in the Brillouin zone. This gives us the band structure of graphene, which can be used to analyze its electronic properties.
</p>

#### **Step 3:** Analyzing the Results
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The band structure calculated in the previous step can be analyzed to determine key properties of graphene. For example, graphene's unique zero band gap (at the Dirac point) is a defining feature of its electronic behavior. By plotting the band structure, we can visualize the electronic dispersion in graphene and identify the energy levels where the conduction and valence bands meet.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To further illustrate how DFT can be applied in material science, letâ€™s discuss another case study focused on reaction mechanisms in catalysis.
</p>

### **Case Study:** Reaction Mechanism in Transition Metal Catalysis
#### **Step 1:** Setting Up the Catalyst
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In catalytic reactions, DFT is often used to simulate the interaction between reactants and the catalystâ€™s surface. Letâ€™s assume we are studying a reaction on the surface of a transition metal catalyst (e.g., platinum). The first step is to model the catalystâ€™s surface and initialize the electron density.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Struct representing a catalyst surface
struct Catalyst {
    metal: String,
    surface_atoms: usize,
}

// Function to initialize the catalyst
impl Catalyst {
    fn new(metal: String, surface_atoms: usize) -> Self {
        Self {
            metal,
            surface_atoms,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let catalyst = Catalyst::new("Platinum".to_string(), 100);
    println!("Catalyst initialized: {} atoms on {} surface.", catalyst.surface_atoms, catalyst.metal);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we define the catalyst surface as a simple collection of surface atoms. For a more complete implementation, you would use a realistic atomic structure of the catalystâ€™s surface.
</p>

#### **Step 2:** Simulating the Reaction Pathway
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Next, we simulate the reaction pathway by calculating the energy barrier for the reaction. Using DFT, we compute the total energy at different points along the reaction coordinate, allowing us to map out the potential energy surface.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Function to simulate reaction energy at different points
fn reaction_energy(reaction_coordinate: f64) -> f64 {
    // Simplified energy barrier model
    let activation_energy = 1.2; // eV
    activation_energy * (1.0 - f64::exp(-reaction_coordinate.powi(2)))
}

fn main() {
    // Simulate reaction energy along the reaction coordinate
    for rc in 0..10 {
        let energy = reaction_energy(rc as f64 / 10.0);
        println!("Reaction coordinate {}: Energy = {:.3} eV", rc, energy);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This simplified code simulates the energy profile of a reaction on the catalystâ€™s surface, showing how DFT can be used to predict reaction mechanisms and energy barriers.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When applying DFT to real-world problems, several challenges can arise. One of the most common is the computational cost, especially for large systems or when using advanced exchange-correlation functionals like hybrid functionals. Balancing accuracy and computational efficiency is essential. Moreover, the choice of basis set and the initial guess for electron density can have a significant impact on convergence and results accuracy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
From the Rust-based implementations, managing memory efficiently and optimizing code for parallel execution are crucial for large-scale DFT simulations. Rustâ€™s strong memory safety features help mitigate issues such as data races and memory leaks, which are particularly important in high-performance computing (HPC) environments.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, DFT provides powerful tools for solving real-world problems in materials science, chemistry, and nanotechnology. Rustâ€™s concurrency features, efficient memory management, and numerical computing libraries make it a suitable language for implementing and optimizing DFT simulations. The case studies presented here demonstrate how DFT can be applied to practical problems such as band structure calculations and reaction mechanisms, illustrating its potential for advancing scientific research.
</p>

# 24.10. Challenges and Future Directions in DFT
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Despite its success in predicting material properties and chemical reactions, Density Functional Theory (DFT) faces several inherent challenges that limit its accuracy and applicability to certain problems. One of the primary challenges is the accuracy of exchange-correlation functionals. The exact form of the exchange-correlation energy is unknown, and commonly used approximations like the Local Density Approximation (LDA) and Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) are often insufficient, especially for systems involving strong correlations or non-local interactions. These functionals can introduce errors when predicting properties like bond energies, band gaps, and reaction barriers, particularly in systems like transition metals or molecules with van der Waals forces.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another significant challenge is the computational cost of DFT, particularly when simulating large systems or employing more sophisticated functionals, such as hybrid functionals (which combine DFT with Hartree-Fock exchange). These calculations scale poorly with system size, limiting the ability to simulate very large molecules, surfaces, or nanostructures.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The treatment of excited states is also a challenge for DFT, which traditionally focuses on ground-state properties. While DFT can approximate excited-state phenomena through extensions like time-dependent DFT (TDDFT), these approaches can still struggle with accuracy, especially in systems with complex electronic excitations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Emerging trends in DFT research aim to address these limitations. One such trend is the development of time-dependent DFT (TDDFT), which extends DFT to study the dynamic behavior of systems under external perturbations, such as time-varying electric fields. TDDFT is increasingly used in the study of optical properties, excited states, and non-equilibrium phenomena, but challenges remain in improving the accuracy and scalability of TDDFT for large systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another trend is the incorporation of machine learning-enhanced functionals, where machine learning algorithms are trained on high-level quantum mechanical data to develop more accurate functionals. These machine learning models can improve the prediction of exchange-correlation energy and offer significant speedups for DFT calculations, although integrating these models into existing DFT frameworks poses its own challenges.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The integration of DFT with quantum computing represents a promising future direction. Quantum computers could potentially solve certain quantum mechanical problems more efficiently than classical computers, including the accurate calculation of electronic structure. While still in its early stages, research into hybrid DFT-quantum computing algorithms is gaining traction, with the potential to revolutionize how electronic structure calculations are performed.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Integration with Quantum Computing: DFT researchers are exploring the integration of classical DFT methods with quantum computing techniques, particularly for solving the SchrÃ¶dinger equation and calculating electron correlation. Quantum algorithms like the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) could offer more accurate solutions for electronic structure problems that are difficult for classical DFT to handle. This would allow for significant improvements in simulating complex systems like high-temperature superconductors and strongly correlated materials.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Improving Exchange-Correlation Functionals: The development of new exchange-correlation functionals is a key area of focus. Efforts to combine machine learning techniques with high-level quantum chemical methods, such as coupled-cluster theory, aim to create more accurate functionals without dramatically increasing computational costs.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s explore how TDDFT could be implemented in Rust for simulating time-dependent phenomena in materials. We begin by defining the time-dependent Hamiltonian and propagating the wavefunction using numerical methods like the Crank-Nicolson scheme. The following code demonstrates how to propagate the wavefunction in time using a time-dependent Hamiltonian:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use nalgebra::{DMatrix, DVector};

// Function to create a time-dependent Hamiltonian
fn time_dependent_hamiltonian(t: f64, size: usize) -> DMatrix<f64> {
    let mut hamiltonian = DMatrix::zeros(size, size);
    let t_factor = (t * 2.0 * std::f64::consts::PI).sin(); // Time-varying component
    for i in 0..size {
        for j in 0..size {
            if i == j {
                hamiltonian[(i, j)] = 1.0 + t_factor; // Diagonal time-dependent potential
            } else {
                hamiltonian[(i, j)] = -1.0; // Off-diagonal hopping terms
            }
        }
    }
    hamiltonian
}

// Crank-Nicolson time propagation
fn crank_nicolson_propagate(psi: &DVector<f64>, hamiltonian: &DMatrix<f64>, dt: f64) -> DVector<f64> {
    let id = DMatrix::<f64>::identity(psi.len(), psi.len());
    let lhs = &id - hamiltonian * (dt / 2.0);
    let rhs = &id + hamiltonian * (dt / 2.0);
    let next_psi = lhs.try_inverse().unwrap() * (rhs * psi);
    next_psi
}

fn main() {
    let size = 10; // Size of the system (number of orbitals)
    let dt = 0.01; // Time step
    let time_steps = 1000; // Number of time steps

    // Initialize wavefunction (simple Gaussian for demo)
    let mut psi = DVector::from_element(size, 1.0 / (size as f64).sqrt());

    for t in 0..time_steps {
        let time = t as f64 * dt;
        let hamiltonian = time_dependent_hamiltonian(time, size);
        psi = crank_nicolson_propagate(&psi, &hamiltonian, dt);

        if t % 100 == 0 {
            println!("Wavefunction at time step {}: {:?}", t, psi);
        }
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, we simulate the time evolution of a wavefunction using a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian includes a time-varying potential, and the wavefunction is propagated in time using the Crank-Nicolson method, a numerically stable scheme for solving time-dependent differential equations. Rustâ€™s strong performance and memory safety ensure that this implementation runs efficiently and safely, even for large systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s concurrency features make it particularly well-suited for high-performance computing environments. Parallelizing DFT simulations can be achieved using libraries such as <code>rayon</code> for thread-based parallelism or by integrating with MPI (Message Passing Interface) for distributed computing across nodes in a cluster. Hereâ€™s how we can parallelize the TDDFT propagation using <code>rayon</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rayon::prelude::*;
use nalgebra::{DMatrix, DVector};

// Parallel Crank-Nicolson time propagation
fn parallel_crank_nicolson(psi: &DVector<f64>, hamiltonian: &DMatrix<f64>, dt: f64) -> DVector<f64> {
    let id = DMatrix::<f64>::identity(psi.len(), psi.len());
    let lhs = &id - hamiltonian * (dt / 2.0);
    let rhs = &id + hamiltonian * (dt / 2.0);
    
    let next_psi = lhs.try_inverse().unwrap() * (rhs * psi);
    next_psi
}

fn main() {
    let size = 1000; // Larger system size for parallelism
    let dt = 0.01;
    let time_steps = 1000;

    let mut psi = DVector::from_element(size, 1.0 / (size as f64).sqrt());

    (0..time_steps).into_par_iter().for_each(|t| {
        let time = t as f64 * dt;
        let hamiltonian = time_dependent_hamiltonian(time, size);
        psi = parallel_crank_nicolson(&psi, &hamiltonian, dt);

        if t % 100 == 0 {
            println!("Wavefunction at time step {}: {:?}", t, psi);
        }
    });
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this version, we parallelize the time propagation using <code>rayon</code>. The Crank-Nicolson propagation is distributed across multiple threads, enabling faster computation for large systems. This parallelism ensures that time-dependent DFT simulations scale effectively, allowing for the simulation of more complex and larger-scale systems.
