# 29.1. Introduction
<p style="text-align: justify;">
We begin by exploring the foundational concepts of wave propagation and scattering, laying the groundwork for both the theoretical understanding and practical simulation of these phenomena using Rust. This section delves into the fundamental principles that govern how various types of wavesâ€”be they acoustic, electromagnetic, or elasticâ€”travel through different media and interact with obstacles, leading to scattering effects. By comprehending these core concepts, one gains the insight necessary to model real-world wave behavior effectively.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Wave propagation is mathematically described by the wave equation, a second-order partial differential equation (PDE) that captures the evolution of wave-like phenomena over both time and space. This equation applies to diverse waves; for instance, sound waves in air, light waves in vacuum or materials, and stress waves in solids. The propagation characteristics of these waves are determined by properties of the mediumâ€”such as density, stiffness, permittivity, and permeabilityâ€”as well as intrinsic wave parameters like speed, frequency, and attenuation. In acoustics, the wave speed is influenced by the bulk modulus and density, whereas in electromagnetics it depends on the material's permittivity and permeability.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Scattering occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or an inhomogeneity in the medium. In such cases the energy of the wave is redistributed in various directions. This phenomenon is often categorized based on the size of the scattering object relative to the wavelength. Rayleigh scattering occurs when the obstacle is much smaller than the wavelength, Mie scattering is observed when the object size is comparable to the wavelength, and geometric scattering takes place when the obstacle is much larger than the wavelength. A thorough understanding of these scattering mechanisms is essential for applications ranging from optical communications and remote sensing to seismic and medical imaging.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
At the heart of these phenomena lies the wave equation, which for a simple harmonic wave can be written as
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u$$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, uu represents the wave function (which could denote displacement, pressure, or field strength), $c$ is the wave speed, tt is time, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator that accounts for spatial variations. The solution to the wave equation is determined by initial conditionsâ€”defining the waveâ€™s initial stateâ€”and boundary conditions that might include reflections or absorptions at interfaces.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In practical implementation, simulating wave propagation and scattering involves solving this wave equation over complex and often large domains. Rust, with its powerful ecosystem of crates, provides an efficient and safe platform for these numerical simulations. Crates such as nalgebra offer robust tools for handling linear algebra operations, while ndarray facilitates efficient manipulation of multi-dimensional arrays, making it possible to handle the large datasets required for realistic wave models.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The following is a simple implementation of a one-dimensional wave equation using the finite difference method (FDM) in Rust. In this example the arrays uu, $u_{\text{prev}}$, and $u_{\text{next}}$ represent the wave displacement at the current, previous, and next time steps, respectively. A localized disturbance is applied at the center of the domain as the initial condition, and the wave is propagated over time using a finite-difference approximation of the second derivative.
</p>

fn simulate_wave_equation(steps: usize, dt: f64, dx: f64, c: f64) {
    // Initialize the wave displacement arrays for the current, previous, and next time steps.
    let mut u: Array1<f64> = Array1::zeros(steps);
    let mut u_prev: Array1<f64> = Array1::zeros(steps);
    let mut u_next: Array1<f64> = Array1::zeros(steps);

    // Set initial condition: a localized displacement in the middle of the domain.
    let mid = steps / 2;
    u[mid] = 1.0;

    // Time stepping loop: update the wave for a fixed number of time steps.
    for _ in 0..1000 {
        for i in 1..steps - 1 {
            // Apply the finite difference method to approximate the second derivative in space.
            u_next[i] = 2.0 * u[i] - u_prev[i] 
                + (c * c * dt * dt / (dx * dx)) * (u[i + 1] - 2.0 * u[i] + u[i - 1]);
        }
        // Shift the time steps: current wave becomes previous and next becomes current.
        u_prev.assign(&u);
        u.assign(&u_next);
    }

    // Output the final wave displacement for further analysis.
    println!("Final wave displacement: {:?}", u_next);

fn main() {
    let steps = 100;  // Define the number of spatial grid points.

    let c = 1.0;      // Define the wave speed.

    simulate_wave_equation(steps, dt, dx, c);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this implementation the finite difference method is used to solve the one-dimensional wave equation. The simulation begins with a localized disturbance at the center of the grid and then iteratively updates the wave state over time using the discretized wave equation. The parameters dtdt, dxdx, and cc control the time evolution and spatial resolution of the simulation. For more complex simulationsâ€”such as two-dimensional or three-dimensional wave propagation, or incorporating more sophisticated boundary conditionsâ€”similar principles apply, albeit with enhanced data handling and computational techniques that may include parallelization or GPU acceleration.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Through these practical implementations Rust demonstrates its power as a tool for computational physics, providing both efficiency and reliability for simulating wave propagation and scattering phenomena in a variety of domains.
</p>

# 29.2. Mathematical Foundations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this section we explore the mathematical underpinnings of wave propagation by focusing on the derivation and solutions of the wave equation in various dimensions. The aim is to bridge the gap between fundamental physical principles and their practical implementation using Rust. Understanding these mathematical foundations is essential for developing accurate simulations that capture the dynamics of wave phenomena in realistic settings.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The wave equation naturally arises from the conservation of energy and momentum. For a scalar field u(x,t)u(x, t) â€“ which may represent displacement, pressure, or another physical quantity â€“ the general form of the wave equation is given by
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u$$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this expression, cc denotes the wave speed, which is determined by the properties of the medium. For instance, in acoustic waves the wave speed depends on the density and stiffness of the medium, while for electromagnetic waves it is governed by the permittivity and permeability. The Laplacian operator $\nabla^2$ u accounts for the spatial variation of the wave, and the equation is valid in one, two, or three dimensions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To understand the origins of the wave equation consider a simple physical system such as a vibrating string under tension. By applying Newton's second law to a small segment of the string one can derive an equation for the displacement that involves the tension, mass density, and the curvature of the string. This derivation generalizes to higher-dimensional systems, such as membranes in 2D or volumes in 3D, where additional complexities such as bending moments and surface forces come into play.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Key parameters in the study of wave propagation include the wave speed cc, the wavelength $\lambda$, and the frequency $f$, which are related by the equation
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$c = \lambda f$$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In dispersive media the wave speed is not constant but varies with frequency. This leads to phenomena such as group velocity and phase velocity that must be carefully considered in simulations. The solutions to the wave equation differ based on the dimensionality of the system. For a one-dimensional system, the solution for a simple harmonic wave traveling in the $x$-direction can be expressed as
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$u(x,t) = A \sin(kx - \omega t)$$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $k$ is the wavenumber and $\omega$ is the angular frequency. In higher dimensions the solutions become more complex and typically involve spherical or cylindrical harmonics. The influence of initial and boundary conditions is crucial; for example, Dirichlet conditions fix the value of $u$ at the boundary while Neumann conditions specify the gradient. Absorbing boundary conditions are often employed in numerical simulations to minimize artificial reflections.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Numerically solving the wave equation requires discretizing both space and time. The finite difference method (FDM) is one of the most common approaches, where continuous derivatives are replaced by finite difference approximations. This allows for the evolution of the wave field over discrete time steps according to the specified initial and boundary conditions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Below is a Rust implementation that demonstrates the numerical solution of the two-dimensional wave equation using the finite difference method. In this code the wave field is represented by a 2D array and updated iteratively over time. A localized displacement is used as the initial condition at the center of the grid.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
extern crate ndarray;
use ndarray::{Array2, s};

/// Simulates the two-dimensional wave equation using the finite difference method.
///
/// This function creates three 2D arrays representing the wave field at the current time step,

/// difference approximation for the Laplacian.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `steps` - The number of spatial grid points in each dimension.
/// * `dt` - The time step size.
/// * `dx` - The spatial step size.
/// * `c` - The wave speed.
fn simulate_2d_wave(steps: usize, dt: f64, dx: f64, c: f64) {
    // Initialize the current, previous, and next wave fields as 2D arrays of zeros.
    let mut u: Array2<f64> = Array2::zeros((steps, steps));
    let mut u_prev: Array2<f64> = Array2::zeros((steps, steps));
    let mut u_next: Array2<f64> = Array2::zeros((steps, steps));

    // Set initial condition: a localized displacement at the center of the grid.
    let mid = steps / 2;
    u[[mid, mid]] = 1.0;

    // Time stepping loop: iterate for a fixed number of time steps.
    for _ in 0..1000 {
        // Update interior points using a central difference scheme.
        for i in 1..steps - 1 {
            for j in 1..steps - 1 {
                u_next[[i, j]] = 2.0 * u[[i, j]] - u_prev[[i, j]]
                    + (c * c * dt * dt / (dx * dx))
                    * (u[[i + 1, j]] + u[[i - 1, j]] + u[[i, j + 1]] + u[[i, j - 1]] - 4.0 * u[[i, j]]);
            }
        }
        // Shift the time steps: the current field becomes the previous and the next becomes current.
        u_prev.assign(&u);
        u.assign(&u_next);
    }

    // Output the final wave field for analysis.
    println!("Final 2D wave field:\n{:?}", u_next);
}

fn main() {
    let steps = 100;  // Number of spatial steps in each dimension.
    let dx = 0.1;     // Spatial step size.
    let dt = 0.01;    // Time step size.
    let c = 1.0;      // Wave speed.

    simulate_2d_wave(steps, dt, dx, c);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example the two-dimensional wave field is updated by computing the Laplacian using finite differences over a grid. The update scheme involves the sum of the wave field values from the four neighboring points, subtracting four times the current value, and scaling by the factor $c^2 \, dt^2 / dx^2$. The simulation advances in time by shifting the field arrays after each iteration. This implementation lays the foundation for more complex simulations that might incorporate advanced boundary conditions, dispersive effects, or even three-dimensional geometries.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To enhance the intuitiveness of the simulation results, visualization tools can be used. For example, the plotters crate in Rust allows the generation of graphical representations of the wave field, providing insight into the evolution of wave propagation, interference, and dispersion phenomena. Such visualizations are critical for validating simulation results and for understanding the dynamic behavior of wave systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By combining these mathematical foundations with robust numerical methods and leveraging Rust's performance and memory safety features, one can build efficient and scalable simulations for studying wave propagation and scattering in one, two, or three dimensions.
</p>

# 29.3. FDTD, FEM, and Spectral Methods
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method is a widely used grid-based technique that solves the wave equation by discretizing both time and space. It directly approximates the derivatives in the wave equation using finite differences, evolving the wave solution at each grid point over successive time steps. FDTD is simple to implement and effective for time-domain simulations, where the focus is on how the wave evolves over time. However, it is highly sensitive to numerical stability, especially when grid spacing or time steps are too large.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Finite Element Method (FEM), in contrast, divides the computational domain into small, interconnected elements. The wave equation is then solved over each element, typically using piecewise polynomials. FEM is particularly useful for complex geometries and inhomogeneous materials, where the domain cannot be easily represented using a regular grid. While FEM tends to be more computationally expensive than FDTD, it provides greater flexibility in handling irregular boundaries and material properties.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Spectral methods solve the wave equation by expanding the solution in terms of basis functions, such as Fourier series or Chebyshev polynomials. These methods are highly accurate because they use global information about the wave field rather than relying on local grid-based approximations. Spectral methods are well-suited for problems where the solution is smooth and the domain is simple (e.g., periodic boundaries), but they can struggle with complex geometries or sharp discontinuities.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In any numerical method, ensuring stability and accuracy is critical. The Courantâ€“Friedrichsâ€“Lewy (CFL) condition is a common criterion used in FDTD to ensure stability. It requires that the time step $\Delta t$ and spatial step $\Delta x$ are small enough to ensure that the numerical wave does not propagate faster than the actual physical wave. The condition is given by:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$ \Delta t \leq \frac{\Delta x}{c} $$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where ccc is the wave speed. Violating this condition can lead to numerical instabilities, causing the simulation to blow up.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Numerical dispersion is another issue that arises when the numerical method introduces artificial phase shifts, leading to waves that propagate at the wrong speed. This is particularly problematic in FDTD, where grid resolution directly affects the accuracy of wave propagation. Reducing grid spacing can minimize dispersion, but it increases computational cost. Spectral methods, by contrast, naturally reduce dispersion due to their high accuracy in representing smooth solutions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Time-domain methods like FDTD simulate how the wave evolves over time, making them well-suited for problems involving transient phenomena, such as pulses or waves interacting with obstacles. Frequency-domain methods, on the other hand, focus on steady-state solutions and are more appropriate for scenarios where the wave has a well-defined frequency (e.g., standing waves or resonances). Spectral methods can operate in either domain, depending on the choice of basis functions and whether a Fourier transform is applied.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Handling non-linearities is another key challenge in large-scale simulations. Non-linear terms in the wave equation can cause interactions between different wave modes, complicating the solution. Techniques like adaptive time-stepping, higher-order finite difference schemes, or hybrid methods combining FDTD and FEM can be used to mitigate these effects in Rust-based simulations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Let's now explore a practical implementation of the FDTD method in Rust for simulating 2D wave propagation. This example focuses on grid-based simulation and demonstrates how to handle large-scale domains efficiently.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This Rust code implements the 2D FDTD method with parallel processing using the <code>rayon</code> crate, which allows for performance optimization on large-scale domains. The wave is initialized with a localized disturbance in the center of the grid, and the wave equation is solved iteratively using the finite difference scheme. The computationally expensive part of the algorithmâ€”the update of the wave fieldâ€”is parallelized across multiple threads using the <code>par_iter()</code> method from <code>rayon</code>, making it highly scalable for large grid sizes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In terms of memory allocation, Rustâ€™s ownership system ensures that there are no race conditions or data corruption when accessing and updating the wave field. The use of arrays like <code>Array2</code> from the <code>ndarray</code> crate provides efficient handling of multi-dimensional data, which is critical when working with large simulation grids. By carefully tuning the grid size (<code>steps</code>), spatial resolution (<code>dx</code>), and time step (<code>dt</code>), we can maintain a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy while adhering to the CFL condition for stability.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In large-scale wave simulations, performance is a key concern. By using libraries like <code>rayon</code>, we can efficiently parallelize the computation, distributing the work across multiple threads or cores. This is especially important when simulating waves over high-resolution grids or when modeling phenomena in three dimensions, where the number of grid points increases exponentially.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To further optimize performance, memory allocation strategies play a crucial role. Rustâ€™s memory safety features prevent issues like memory leaks and buffer overflows, which are common in traditional scientific computing languages. By using stack-allocated arrays or minimizing heap allocations, Rust ensures efficient memory use, which is critical for long-running simulations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to <code>rayon</code>, Rust's native concurrency libraries like <code>tokio</code> can be leveraged for even more sophisticated parallel processing, especially when integrating with I/O operations such as real-time data visualization or streaming large datasets to external storage.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Numerical methods such as FDTD, FEM, and spectral methods form the backbone of wave propagation simulations. Each method offers different trade-offs in terms of stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Rustâ€™s ecosystem, with its rich set of crates like <code>ndarray</code> and <code>rayon</code>, provides an ideal platform for implementing these methods in a safe and efficient manner. By leveraging parallel processing and memory safety features, Rust enables large-scale simulations to run efficiently, while maintaining the precision required for solving complex wave phenomena.

# 29.4. Scattering Theory
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Scattering theory studies how wavesâ€”be they acoustic, electromagnetic, or elasticâ€”interact with objects in their path. When a wave encounters an obstacle the energy of the incident wave is redistributed in different directions. One key measure in scattering theory is the scattering cross-section, denoted by Ïƒ\\sigma, which quantifies the effective area that intercepts and scatters the incoming wave. This parameter is essential in characterizing the scattering behavior of an object and is widely used in applications such as remote sensing, radar system design, and optical analysis.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In scattering processes it is important to distinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering. In elastic scattering the total energy of the wave is conserved with only the direction of propagation changing, while in inelastic scattering the energy of the wave changes, resulting in shifts in frequency or wavelength. Elastic scattering is common in phenomena such as light scattering by small particles or sound waves interacting with rigid surfaces, whereas inelastic scattering, for example in Raman scattering, involves energy exchange with the medium and is fundamental in spectroscopic techniques.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Different scatterers require different mathematical models. For instance, spherical scatterers can often be modeled analytically using Mie theory, which provides an exact solution of Maxwellâ€™s equations for electromagnetic waves interacting with a sphere. In contrast, scattering from cylindrical or irregular objects typically requires approximate analytical methods or numerical techniques. The Method of Moments (MoM) is a powerful numerical approach that reformulates the continuous integral equations describing the scattering process into a discrete system of linear equations. In MoM the surface of the scatterer is divided into small elements and the induced surface currents are calculated, from which the scattered field is derived.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Scattering theory finds broad applications in various fields. In optics, Rayleigh scattering explains why the sky appears blue, while Mie scattering describes how light interacts with particles comparable in size to the wavelength, such as water droplets in clouds. In acoustics the theory underpins sonar systems used in underwater detection, and in medical imaging scattering is critical in modalities like ultrasound and optical coherence tomography (OCT).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To illustrate these concepts, we can simulate the far-field scattering pattern for a spherical scatterer using a simplified approach based on the Method of Moments. In this example we use the nalgebra crate to handle vector and matrix operations. The far-field approximation is applied whereby the scattered field is assumed to be proportional to the induced surface currents and inversely proportional to the scattererâ€™s radius. The wavenumber $k$ is given by $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ where $\lambda$ is the wavelength.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Below is an example implementation in Rust.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this implementation the scattering pattern is calculated over 100 discretized angular positions around a spherical scatterer. A simplified far-field approximation is used to compute the field amplitude based on the scattererâ€™s radius and the wavenumber, and the intensity is then obtained as the square of this amplitude. The nalgebra crate is employed to manage vector operations, and the results are printed in a human-readable format. In more advanced simulations the Method of Moments would involve discretizing the scattererâ€™s surface, formulating the interaction matrix using an appropriate Greenâ€™s function, and solving for the induced surface currents using a linear solver.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Scattering theory not only provides insight into fundamental physical interactions but also has practical applications in optics, acoustics, and medical imaging. The approach outlined here illustrates the basic principles behind scattering computations and demonstrates how numerical methods can be implemented in Rust to simulate real-world scattering phenomena. More sophisticated techniques may involve detailed surface discretization, advanced numerical solvers, and visualization tools to fully capture both near-field and far-field effects.

# 29.5. Boundary Conditions
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Boundary conditions define how waves behave at the edges of a computational domain and are critical in ensuring that numerical simulations accurately represent physical reality. In a closed system fixed or reflective boundaries are typically employed so that the wave energy is either contained within or reflected back into the domain. In contrast, when simulating open systemsâ€”for instance waves propagating in the atmosphere or electromagnetic fields radiating into free spaceâ€”it is essential to implement absorbing boundaries that allow outgoing waves to leave the domain without reflecting back and contaminating the solution.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) and Perfectly Matched Layers (PMLs) are common techniques to mimic an infinite domain. PMLs, in particular, are designed to absorb all outgoing waves regardless of their angle of incidence or frequency. They work by gradually damping the wave amplitude as it approaches the boundary; this damping is introduced through a spatially varying coefficient that increases near the edges of the computational grid. The modified wave equation in a PML region can be written as
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u - \sigma(x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}$$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $\sigma(x)$ is the damping coefficient that increases with proximity to the boundary. This formulation ensures that waves are smoothly attenuated as they exit the domain, thereby reducing spurious reflections.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In practice PMLs are implemented as layers surrounding the main simulation domain. Within these layers the damping coefficient is gradually increased so that the wave amplitude is reduced over several grid points. This gradual transition minimizes any numerical discontinuities that could otherwise lead to reflections.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Below is a Rust implementation of PMLs in a two-dimensional wave simulation. In this example the function <code>apply_pml_boundary</code> creates a damping field based on the distance from the grid boundaries. The main simulation function <code>simulate_wave_with_pml</code> then incorporates this damping into the finite difference update of the wave equation. The use of the ndarray crate ensures efficient manipulation of the 2D arrays required to represent the wave field and the damping profile.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this implementation the <code>apply_pml_boundary</code> function computes a two-dimensional damping field where the damping increases smoothly as grid points approach the domain boundaries. This damping field is then applied in the update equation within the PML region in the <code>simulate_wave_with_pml</code> function. The damping term modifies the standard finite difference update to gradually reduce the wave amplitude, effectively absorbing outgoing waves. Rustâ€™s ndarray crate is used to handle the 2D arrays efficiently, while the overall design ensures that the simulation maintains numerical stability by appropriately tuning the damping factor, time step, and grid resolution.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The careful selection of parameters such as $dt$, $dx$, and the CFL condition remains critical for ensuring stability. In addition the PML parameters (damping_factor and pml_thickness) must be tuned to effectively absorb waves without introducing spurious reflections. This implementation can be extended further to include more sophisticated boundary conditions, visualization of the wave field, or parallel processing for larger simulation domains.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Boundary conditions, and specifically the use of PMLs, play a pivotal role in accurately modeling open-domain wave propagation. By absorbing outgoing waves and preventing artificial reflections the simulation better represents real-world scenarios. Rustâ€™s performance and memory safety features make it an excellent choice for these complex numerical simulations, ensuring that large-scale models are both efficient and robust.

# 29.6. Wave Propagation in Complex Media
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Wave propagation in homogeneous isotropic media is straightforward: the wave speed is constant and the direction of propagation remains uniform. In contrast, when waves travel through heterogeneous media, material properties such as density, stiffness, permittivity, or permeability vary spatially, causing the wave speed to fluctuate. For example, seismic waves in geological formations encounter layers with differing properties resulting in refraction reflection and scattering. Anisotropic media further complicate the picture by exhibiting directional dependence; in crystals, for instance, waves travel at different speeds along different crystallographic axes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In complex environments the classical wave equation must be modified to account for spatially varying wave speed. For a heterogeneous medium the wave equation becomes
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = \nabla \cdot \left( c(x,y,z)^2 \nabla u \right)$$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $u(x,t)$ is the wave function and $c(x,y,z)$ is the position-dependent wave speed. This formulation results in wavefronts that change shape and velocity as they encounter regions with different material properties. Nonlinear effects can also arise in such media when the relationship between wave amplitude and speed becomes nonlinear. In these cases additional terms, for example
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u + \alpha\, u\, \nabla^2 u,$$
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
may appear in the governing equations where Î±\\alpha is a nonlinearity coefficient. Nonlinear effects such as harmonic generation or shock formation further complicate the solution and require sophisticated numerical techniques and adaptive schemes to resolve steep gradients and discontinuities.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To simulate wave propagation in complex media efficiently, one common approach is to use adaptive meshing techniques. Adaptive meshing allows the spatial resolution to vary throughout the domain so that regions with rapid variations or material boundaries receive finer resolution while other regions are computed with a coarser grid. Furthermore Rustâ€™s concurrency features can be leveraged to distribute the computational workload across multiple threads, enhancing the simulation efficiency.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Below is an example in Rust that demonstrates 2D wave propagation in a heterogeneous medium using a finite difference method (FDM) with adaptive meshing elements represented by a spatially varying wave speed. The simulation uses a grid stored in an Array2 from the ndarray crate. In the example the wave speed is higher in the center of the domain to simulate a region with distinct material properties. A localized disturbance is initialized at the center and the wave equation is updated over time.

The simulation can be further enhanced by incorporating more advanced adaptive meshing techniques and nonlinear terms if necessary.

# 29.7. Scattering Analysis
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Scattering analysis involves quantifying how waves interact with objects and how their properties such as phase shift amplitude and polarization change as a result of this interaction. When a wave encounters an obstacle its energy is redistributed, providing valuable insight into the size shape and material composition of the scatterer. For instance analyzing the phase shift between the incident and reflected waves allows radar and sonar systems to estimate both distance and velocity. Additionally the angular distribution of the scattered energy reveals how the intensity of the wave varies with direction. In the far-field region where the distance from the scatterer is much larger than the wavelength the scattered wavefronts become essentially planar and the analysis simplifies considerably. In contrast the near-field region involves spherical wavefronts and complex interactions that require more detailed numerical methods.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In scattering problems it is common to separate the total field into the incident field and the scattered field. Techniques such as phase-shift keying are then used to extract information about the scatterer from the phase and amplitude changes observed in the scattered wave. The Method of Moments (MoM) is one of the standard numerical methods used in scattering analysis; it converts the continuous integral equations describing the waveâ€“object interaction into a system of linear equations that can be solved to determine the induced currents on the scattererâ€™s surface. These currents in turn determine the scattered field. While a full MoM implementation may require detailed surface discretization and solving large linear systems, simplified models using far-field approximations can provide useful insight into the angular distribution of scattered energy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the following example we simulate a simple two-dimensional far-field scattering problem. We consider a circular scatterer illuminated by an incident plane wave. The far-field approximation is used to compute the phase shift and amplitude of the scattered wave at various angles. The wavenumber kk is computed from the wavelength $\lambda$ via $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$. The scattering intensity is then estimated as being proportional to the square of the amplitude multiplied by a cosine function of the phase shift. The nalgebra crate is used for vector operations and the results are printed to the terminal.

The provided Rust code examples cover a range of approaches from simple terminal-based visualization to advanced graphical plotting and parallel computation using Rayon.

# 29.8. HPC for Wave Propagation and Scattering
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Wave propagation and scattering problems inherently involve massive datasets and complex computations that often require the capabilities of high-performance computing (HPC) to simulate accurately. In scenarios such as seismic wave modeling, electromagnetic field analysis, or fluid acoustics, the simulation domains can span large regions with fine resolution and heterogeneous properties. HPC techniques are essential because they enable these demanding simulations to run efficiently by leveraging parallel processing on multi-core CPUs or GPUs. By distributing the computational workload across many processors, HPC reduces overall simulation time and allows for high-resolution models that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
At a conceptual level, the efficiency of large-scale simulations depends on several key factors. Domain decomposition divides the overall simulation area into smaller subdomains that can be computed independently and concurrently. Effective memory management is critical to ensure that large datasetsâ€”such as those representing spatial fields and material propertiesâ€”are stored and accessed efficiently. Load balancing plays an important role in distributing work evenly across processing units so that no single core or node becomes a bottleneck. Together these techniques form the backbone of HPC implementations for wave propagation and scattering.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s ecosystem provides excellent tools for HPC applications. Libraries such as rayon and tokio offer powerful abstractions for multi-threading and asynchronous concurrency, respectively, while GPU acceleration can be achieved with crates like wgpu that interface with modern graphics hardware. These tools allow developers to harness the full computational power of modern hardware while maintaining Rustâ€™s guarantees of memory safety and performance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Below is an example that demonstrates a Rust-based parallel wave simulation using the rayon crate. In this example a simple wave function is defined, and the simulation domain is discretized into a vector of positions. The simulate_wave function computes a sine wave at a given position and time. By using rayonâ€™s parallel iterators, the workload is distributed across multiple threads, allowing for efficient computation over a large domain.

///

/// The wave amplitude at position `x` and time `t`.
fn simulate_wave(x: f64, t: f64) -> f64 {
    // A basic sine wave model representing wave propagation.
    (2.0 * PI * (x - t)).sin()
}

fn main() {
    // Define the spatial domain as a vector of positions.
    let domain: Vec<f64> = (0..1000).map(|x| x as f64 * 0.01).collect();
    let time = 1.0;
    
    // Perform parallel computation of the wave simulation using rayon.
    let results: Vec<f64> = domain.par_iter()
        .map(|&x| simulate_wave(x, time))
        .collect();

    // Output the results for each position in the domain.
    for (i, result) in results.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("Wave at position {}: {:.4}", i, result);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the above code the spatial domain is defined as a vector of positions. The simulate_wave function models a sine wave propagating over time. By employing rayonâ€™s parallel iterator (<code>par_iter()</code>), the simulation of the wave at each spatial position is computed concurrently, thus significantly reducing the overall processing time compared to a sequential implementation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For even greater performance gains, particularly for large-scale simulations, GPU acceleration can be employed using Rustâ€™s wgpu crate. GPU acceleration is particularly beneficial when the simulation involves intensive numerical computations over very large datasets. The following example illustrates a simplified GPU-accelerated wave simulation using wgpu. In this example the GPU is set up and a compute shader written in WGSL (WebGPU Shading Language) is used to perform a simple wave calculation on an array of domain values.

In this GPU-accelerated example, the wgpu crate is used to set up a compute pipeline. A WGSL shader is defined to perform a simple sine transformation on an array representing the wave domain. Although the shader shown here is simplified, in a complete simulation it would incorporate time and spatial variables to simulate realistic wave propagation. This approach demonstrates how GPU acceleration can significantly speed up simulations that involve large-scale numerical computations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Both the multi-threaded CPU approach using rayon and the GPU-accelerated approach using wgpu showcase how HPC techniques can be applied in Rust to address the demands of large-scale wave propagation and scattering simulations. For extremely large or complex simulations, further scalability can be achieved through distributed computing frameworks or by combining multiple HPC strategies. Rustâ€™s memory safety, concurrency primitives, and efficient data handling make it an excellent choice for implementing such high-performance simulations.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, the use of HPC for wave propagation and scattering allows researchers and engineers to tackle computationally intensive problems by leveraging parallel processing on both CPUs and GPUs. Rustâ€™s robust ecosystem provides the necessary tools to develop efficient, scalable, and safe simulations, meeting the computational challenges posed by real-world applications.

# 29.9. Case Studies: Wave Propagation and Scattering
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Understanding wave propagation and scattering is essential for a wide range of applications, from seismic monitoring and earthquake engineering to telecommunications and underwater acoustics. Waves propagate through different media, interacting with various obstacles and inhomogeneities, which causes them to scatter. In seismic modeling, for example, waves generated by earthquakes travel through layers of the Earth that differ in density and elasticity. These variations cause the waves to refract reflect and scatter, which is crucial information for oil exploration and environmental monitoring. In telecommunications electromagnetic wave propagation through the atmosphere or cables is fundamental to designing efficient communication systems. Similarly in underwater acoustics sound waves are used for navigation and marine biology, where scattering by obstacles such as the seabed or marine organisms provides valuable data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Simulations serve as a powerful tool to visualize and quantify these complex interactions. By constructing numerical models that solve the wave equation under various conditions engineers and scientists can predict the behavior of waves in environments that are too challenging or impractical to measure directly. For instance seismic wave modeling can help predict how structures will respond during an earthquake, while electromagnetic simulations can optimize antenna designs or radar cross-section analyses. Rust's combination of performance efficiency and safe memory management makes it particularly well-suited for these large-scale, high-resolution simulations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The following example demonstrates a case study in seismic wave modeling using Rust. The simulation models two-dimensional wave propagation through the Earth's layers with a finite-difference method. In this example the computational grid is defined by NX and NY points with specified grid spacings DX and DY. Two matrices represent the wave field at the current and previous time steps. The propagate_wave function computes the second spatial derivatives using central differences, and the wave field is updated in accordance with the wave equation. This case study highlights how Rustâ€™s linear algebra libraries and efficient looping constructs can be leveraged for complex numerical simulations.

In this seismic case study the wavefield is modeled using a 2D grid with finite difference approximations of the spatial second derivatives.

Such simulations are essential for predicting the response of geological structures to seismic events and for applications in oil exploration and environmental monitoring.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Similar case studies can be developed for electromagnetic wave propagation, where material parameters such as permittivity and permeability would replace density and stiffness, or for underwater acoustics, where sound wave propagation is analyzed. In each case the underlying numerical methods share similarities in structure though the specific parameters and governing equations differ.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This case study demonstrates that by using Rustâ€™s efficient numerical libraries such as nalgebra for matrix operations and by writing robust iterative loops, one can build simulations that handle complex wave phenomena. Rustâ€™s performance and memory safety features ensure that even large-scale simulations remain reliable and efficient, making it a powerful tool for scientific computing in diverse fields such as geophysics telecommunications and marine acoustics.

# 29.10. Challenges and Future Directions
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Wave propagation and scattering problems encompass a wide range of scales and physical phenomena, making them some of the most computationally demanding challenges in scientific computing. In real-world applications waves interact with complex media where properties such as density, stiffness, and dielectric constant can vary over many orders of magnitude. This multiscale nature means that a single simulation may need to resolve microscopic features, such as the fine details of a material microstructure, as well as macroscopic phenomena like seismic wave propagation through the Earth's crust. Capturing all these scales accurately in one simulation requires enormous computational resources and sophisticated numerical algorithms.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Furthermore, many wave phenomena exhibit non-linear behavior. Non-linear effects occur when the response of the medium changes with the amplitude of the wave. This is seen in high-amplitude acoustic waves, plasma physics, or in the formation of shock waves in fluids. Non-linear wave equations include additional terms that cause interactions between different wave modes, making analytical solutions infeasible and demanding advanced iterative solvers or adaptive schemes. Hybrid methods that combine the strengths of different numerical techniques, such as coupling finite element methods (FEM) with boundary element methods (BEM), offer promising solutions but present significant implementation challenges.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
From a conceptual standpoint, there is a growing trend towards integrating wave propagation models with other physical phenomena. For example, in weather forecasting or fluid dynamics, wave propagation models are coupled with fluid flow equations like Navierâ€“Stokes to simulate the interplay between atmospheric waves and wind fields. In structural health monitoring, seismic wave propagation models are integrated with solid mechanics to predict how an earthquake will affect a building. These interdisciplinary approaches require solving large systems of coupled equations, further increasing the computational complexity.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One promising future direction is the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques into traditional numerical methods. ML models, once trained on high-fidelity simulation data, can rapidly approximate the behavior of waves under new conditions, potentially reducing the computational cost. Neural networks and other ML algorithms can be integrated as surrogates for parts of the simulation, providing fast approximations that complement traditional solvers.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s ecosystem is well positioned to address these challenges. Its memory safety guarantees combined with high performance and efficient concurrency primitives make it ideal for large-scale simulations. Rust libraries like rayon enable robust multi-threading, and integration with GPU frameworks (such as wgpu) further enhances computational throughput. Additionally, Rustâ€™s growing support for machine learning through libraries like tch-rs opens up avenues for hybrid simulation methods that merge traditional numerical techniques with ML approximations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The following examples illustrate some practical approaches to tackling these challenges in Rust. The first example leverages multi-threading with the rayon crate to simulate wave propagation at multiple scales concurrently. The second example demonstrates a basic integration of machine learning using the tch-rs crate to approximate wave amplitudes.
</p>

### **Example 1: Multi-Scale Wave Simulation with Rayon**

In this example we simulate wave propagation at different scales concurrently using Rustâ€™s rayon crate. The function <code>simulate_wave</code> computes a simple sine wave that represents the propagation of a wave at a given frequency. By processing multiple frequency scales in parallel we can efficiently explore the multiscale behavior of the system.
