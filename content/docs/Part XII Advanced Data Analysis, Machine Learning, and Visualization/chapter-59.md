# 59.1. Introduction to Uncertainty Quantification in Physics Simulations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Lets begin with an introduction to Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in the context of physics simulations, emphasizing its crucial role in enhancing the reliability of predictions and simulations. UQ provides a structured approach to understand and manage the uncertainty inherent in physical models, data, and numerical methods. By assessing and quantifying these uncertainties, scientists and engineers can make more robust predictions and improve confidence in simulation results. Uncertainty in physics simulations arises from several sources, including:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Uncertainty in input data: Experimental data used to initialize the model may be noisy or incomplete.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Uncertainty in model parameters: Physical constants or model parameters may have unknown or imprecise values.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Initial and boundary conditions: The conditions set at the start of a simulation or at the boundaries of the domain may be uncertain or estimated.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Numerical methods: Approximation errors due to discretization, rounding, or convergence issues introduce additional uncertainty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These uncertainties affect the outcomes of simulations and must be properly quantified to assess the confidence level of the predictions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Uncertainty in simulations can be broadly classified into two categories:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Aleatoric Uncertainty: This represents the inherent randomness or variability in the system being simulated. Examples include thermal fluctuations in material properties or stochastic processes in quantum mechanics. Aleatoric uncertainty is often irreducible because it is a fundamental property of the system.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Epistemic Uncertainty: This type of uncertainty arises from a lack of knowledge about the system or model. It can often be reduced through better measurements, improved models, or more precise parameter estimation. For instance, in climate modeling, epistemic uncertainty can arise from unknown feedback mechanisms or incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In physics simulations, UQ helps differentiate between these two types of uncertainties and allows modelers to assess which uncertainties can be reduced through further research or more accurate data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The key role of UQ is to ensure that simulation results are robust, meaning they remain valid even when uncertainties in the inputs or parameters are considered. This leads to higher confidence in the predictions made by simulations, whether in predicting material properties under different conditions, forecasting climate changes, or modeling nuclear reactions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Now, letâ€™s explore UQ through practical examples in Rust. Weâ€™ll implement a simplified UQ process where we model the prediction of a materialâ€™s thermal conductivity under varying temperatures, incorporating uncertainty in both the input data (temperature) and model parameters.
</p>

#### **Example:** Uncertainty Quantification in Material Property Prediction
{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rand::Rng;
use rand_distr::{Normal, Distribution};
use ndarray::Array1;

// Define the material property model (e.g., thermal conductivity as a function of temperature)
fn thermal_conductivity_model(temp: f64, coeff: f64, intercept: f64) -> f64 {
    coeff * temp + intercept
}

// Simulate data with uncertainty in temperature measurements and model parameters
fn simulate_conductivity_data(temps: &[f64], true_coeff: f64, true_intercept: f64, temp_noise: f64) -> Vec<f64> {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    let temp_dist = Normal::new(0.0, temp_noise).unwrap();
    temps.iter().map(|&t| {
        let noisy_temp = t + temp_dist.sample(&mut rng);
        thermal_conductivity_model(noisy_temp, true_coeff, true_intercept)
    }).collect()
}

// Compute the uncertainty in the conductivity predictions using Monte Carlo sampling
fn quantify_uncertainty(temps: &[f64], coeff_samples: &[f64], intercept_samples: &[f64], temp_noise: f64) -> Vec<f64> {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    let temp_dist = Normal::new(0.0, temp_noise).unwrap();

    let mut predictions = vec![0.0; temps.len()];
    for (&t, prediction) in temps.iter().zip(predictions.iter_mut()) {
        // Sample the model parameters and compute predictions
        let temp_sample = t + temp_dist.sample(&mut rng);
        let coeff_sample = coeff_samples[rng.gen_range(0..coeff_samples.len())];
        let intercept_sample = intercept_samples[rng.gen_range(0..intercept_samples.len())];
        *prediction = thermal_conductivity_model(temp_sample, coeff_sample, intercept_sample);
    }
    predictions
}

fn main() {
    // Define temperature data (input data)
    let temps = vec![300.0, 350.0, 400.0, 450.0, 500.0]; // Temperatures in Kelvin

    // True model parameters for thermal conductivity
    let true_coeff = 0.02; // Coefficient for temperature dependence
    let true_intercept = 1.0; // Baseline thermal conductivity
    let temp_noise = 5.0; // Uncertainty in temperature measurements (in Kelvin)

    // Simulate conductivity data with uncertainty in temperature
    let data = simulate_conductivity_data(&temps, true_coeff, true_intercept, temp_noise);

    // Sample coefficient and intercept for uncertainty quantification
    let coeff_samples: Vec<f64> = (0..100).map(|_| 0.02 + rand::thread_rng().gen_range(-0.001..0.001)).collect();
    let intercept_samples: Vec<f64> = (0..100).map(|_| 1.0 + rand::thread_rng().gen_range(-0.05..0.05)).collect();

    // Quantify uncertainty in predictions using Monte Carlo sampling
    let predictions = quantify_uncertainty(&temps, &coeff_samples, &intercept_samples, temp_noise);

    // Display the predictions with quantified uncertainty
    for (temp, prediction) in temps.iter().zip(predictions.iter()) {
        println!("Temperature: {:.1} K, Predicted Conductivity: {:.4} W/mK", temp, prediction);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we model the thermal conductivity of a material as a function of temperature with uncertainty in both the temperature measurements and the model parameters (i.e., the coefficient and intercept). The true thermal conductivity follows a linear relationship with temperature, but in practice, both the input data (temperature) and model parameters contain uncertainty.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Monte Carlo sampling approach is used to quantify the uncertainty in the predictions. By generating random samples for the model parameters and the input data (temperatures), we propagate these uncertainties through the model to generate a distribution of predicted thermal conductivities. This provides insight into how uncertain the predictions are, given the uncertainties in the input data and model. Some applications in Physics:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Material Property Prediction: UQ is essential in materials science, where material properties such as thermal conductivity, tensile strength, or elasticity depend on uncertain factors like temperature, composition, and manufacturing conditions.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Climate Modeling: UQ plays a vital role in climate models, where uncertainties in atmospheric data (e.g., humidity, wind speed) and model parameters (e.g., feedback effects) significantly affect predictions.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Nuclear Simulations: In nuclear physics, UQ is crucial when simulating reactions where both model parameters and physical conditions (e.g., energy levels, cross-sections) introduce uncertainties into the results.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing UQ in large-scale, complex systems poses several challenges:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Computational cost: Sampling methods like Monte Carlo require large numbers of simulations to accurately quantify uncertainty, which can be computationally expensive for high-dimensional problems.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Correlation of uncertainties: In complex systems, uncertainties in different parameters may be correlated, making it difficult to isolate and quantify individual sources of uncertainty.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">High-dimensional parameter spaces: As the number of uncertain parameters increases, the dimensionality of the problem grows, making it harder to efficiently explore the parameter space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust's performance and concurrency capabilities make it well-suited for handling large-scale UQ simulations, enabling the efficient computation of uncertainty even in high-dimensional and complex systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Uncertainty quantification is a critical tool in physics simulations, allowing scientists to assess the reliability and robustness of their predictions. By identifying and quantifying both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, UQ provides a framework for understanding how uncertainties in input data, parameters, and models propagate through simulations. The example of material property prediction demonstrated how Rust can be used to implement UQ in practical settings, leveraging Monte Carlo sampling to propagate uncertainties and quantify their impact on simulation results. Through its efficient handling of complex systems and large-scale simulations, Rust is well-positioned to support uncertainty quantification in computational physics.
</p>

# 59.2. Probabilistic Approaches to Uncertainty Quantification
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this section, we dive into probabilistic approaches to Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), focusing on the use of probability distributions to represent uncertainties in model parameters and inputs. These probabilistic methods are critical in quantifying both aleatoric (inherent randomness) and epistemic (lack of knowledge) uncertainties in simulations. By leveraging techniques such as Monte Carlo methods, Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), and Bayesian inference, we can propagate uncertainties through physical models and improve the reliability of predictions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Probabilistic UQ aims to model uncertainties by assigning probability distributions to uncertain parameters, inputs, and initial conditions in a simulation. These distributions represent the range of possible values that a parameter might take and the likelihood of each value. For example, in a fluid dynamics simulation, the viscosity of a fluid may not be known exactly but can be represented as a normal distribution with a certain mean and standard deviation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The key idea is to quantify the effect of these uncertain parameters on the simulation outcomes by sampling from the probability distributions and propagating these samples through the model. This provides a range of possible outcomes, allowing us to assess the confidence intervals and reliability of the predictions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Several techniques are commonly used in probabilistic UQ:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Monte Carlo Methods: Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful technique that involves generating random samples from the input distributions and propagating them through the model. By running the simulation for a large number of samples, we can estimate the distribution of the output and compute statistics such as the mean, variance, and credible intervals.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS): LHS is an advanced sampling technique that improves upon basic Monte Carlo by stratifying the input space into equal probability intervals, ensuring that each part of the distribution is sampled evenly. This leads to more efficient sampling and better coverage of the input space, especially in high-dimensional problems.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Bayesian Inference: Bayesian methods provide a framework for updating our beliefs about the model parameters based on observed data. By assigning prior distributions to the parameters, we can use Bayesian inference to compute the posterior distributions, which reflect both the prior knowledge and the new information from the data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The importance of probability distributions in modeling uncertainties cannot be overstated. Aleatoric uncertainties are typically modeled using well-known distributions like the normal, uniform, or exponential distributions. Epistemic uncertainties, on the other hand, often require more complex modeling, such as assigning informative priors in Bayesian inference.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s now explore a practical implementation of Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian inference for UQ in Rust. We will apply these methods to a simple fluid dynamics example, where we simulate the uncertainty in the fluid velocity based on uncertain viscosity and pressure drop.
</p>

#### **Example:** Probabilistic UQ in Fluid Dynamics using Monte Carlo
{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rand::Rng;
use rand_distr::{Normal, Distribution};
use ndarray::Array1;

// Define a fluid dynamics model (e.g., velocity as a function of pressure drop and viscosity)
fn fluid_velocity_model(pressure_drop: f64, viscosity: f64) -> f64 {
    pressure_drop / viscosity // Simplified model: velocity is proportional to pressure drop over viscosity
}

// Simulate fluid velocity data using Monte Carlo sampling
fn monte_carlo_simulation(pressure_drop: f64, viscosity_mean: f64, viscosity_std: f64, num_samples: usize) -> Vec<f64> {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    let viscosity_dist = Normal::new(viscosity_mean, viscosity_std).unwrap();

    (0..num_samples)
        .map(|_| {
            let viscosity_sample = viscosity_dist.sample(&mut rng);
            fluid_velocity_model(pressure_drop, viscosity_sample)
        })
        .collect()
}

// Compute statistics from the Monte Carlo simulation
fn compute_statistics(samples: &[f64]) -> (f64, f64) {
    let mean: f64 = samples.iter().sum::<f64>() / samples.len() as f64;
    let variance: f64 = samples.iter().map(|&x| (x - mean).powi(2)).sum::<f64>() / (samples.len() as f64);
    (mean, variance.sqrt()) // Return mean and standard deviation
}

fn main() {
    // Parameters for the simulation
    let pressure_drop = 10.0; // Pressure drop in Pascals
    let viscosity_mean = 1.0; // Mean viscosity in PaÂ·s
    let viscosity_std = 0.2;  // Standard deviation of viscosity
    let num_samples = 1000;   // Number of Monte Carlo samples

    // Perform Monte Carlo simulation
    let velocity_samples = monte_carlo_simulation(pressure_drop, viscosity_mean, viscosity_std, num_samples);

    // Compute and display the results
    let (mean_velocity, std_velocity) = compute_statistics(&velocity_samples);
    println!("Mean fluid velocity: {:.2} m/s", mean_velocity);
    println!("Uncertainty (standard deviation): {:.2} m/s", std_velocity);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we simulate the fluid velocity using a simple model where the velocity is proportional to the pressure drop divided by the viscosity. We assume that the viscosity is uncertain and modeled as a normal distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation. Using Monte Carlo sampling, we generate a large number of samples from the viscosity distribution, propagate these samples through the model, and compute the resulting distribution of fluid velocities.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The results include the mean fluid velocity and its uncertainty (standard deviation), providing insight into how uncertainties in the viscosity affect the predicted velocity.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to Monte Carlo, Bayesian inference can be used to update the viscosity parameter based on observed data, incorporating both prior knowledge and new information. The posterior distribution of the viscosity can then be propagated through the fluid dynamics model to quantify the uncertainty in the velocity prediction.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rand_distr::{Normal, Distribution};

// Likelihood function: P(data | viscosity)
fn likelihood(data: &[f64], pressure_drop: f64, viscosity: f64, noise: f64) -> f64 {
    let normal = Normal::new(0.0, noise).unwrap();
    data.iter().map(|&v| {
        let predicted_velocity = fluid_velocity_model(pressure_drop, viscosity);
        normal.pdf(v - predicted_velocity)
    }).product()
}

// Bayesian update using Metropolis-Hastings for viscosity estimation
fn bayesian_update(data: &[f64], pressure_drop: f64, prior_mean: f64, prior_std: f64, noise: f64) -> f64 {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    let proposal_dist = Normal::new(0.0, 0.1).unwrap();

    // Initial guess for viscosity
    let mut current_viscosity = prior_mean;

    for _ in 0..1000 {
        let proposed_viscosity = current_viscosity + proposal_dist.sample(&mut rng);
        let likelihood_current = likelihood(data, pressure_drop, current_viscosity, noise);
        let likelihood_proposed = likelihood(data, pressure_drop, proposed_viscosity, noise);

        // Metropolis-Hastings acceptance criterion
        if likelihood_proposed / likelihood_current > rng.gen::<f64>() {
            current_viscosity = proposed_viscosity;
        }
    }

    current_viscosity
}

fn main() {
    // Simulated observed velocity data
    let pressure_drop = 10.0; // Pressure drop in Pascals
    let true_viscosity = 1.0; // True viscosity in PaÂ·s
    let noise = 0.1; // Measurement noise
    let data = monte_carlo_simulation(pressure_drop, true_viscosity, noise, 10);

    // Perform Bayesian update to estimate viscosity
    let prior_mean = 1.0;  // Prior mean for viscosity
    let prior_std = 0.5;   // Prior standard deviation for viscosity
    let estimated_viscosity = bayesian_update(&data, pressure_drop, prior_mean, prior_std, noise);

    println!("Estimated viscosity: {:.2} PaÂ·s", estimated_viscosity);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to estimate the viscosity parameter from observed velocity data. The Bayesian update incorporates prior knowledge about the viscosity and updates the posterior distribution based on the observed data. This updated estimate can then be used in the fluid dynamics model to predict the fluid velocity with reduced uncertainty.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Probabilistic approaches to UQ, such as Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian inference, provide a robust framework for quantifying uncertainties in physical models. By representing uncertainties in parameters and inputs as probability distributions, these methods allow us to propagate uncertainties through the model and compute meaningful statistics about the outputs. In the context of fluid dynamics, the Monte Carlo method provided insight into the variability of the fluid velocity due to uncertainty in viscosity, while Bayesian inference enabled us to refine our estimates based on observed data. Rustâ€™s performance advantages make it a strong platform for implementing these UQ techniques in large-scale simulations.
</p>

# 59.3. Non-Probabilistic Methods for Uncertainty Quantification
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, we explore non-probabilistic methods for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), which are essential when precise probability distributions are unavailable or the data is too vague or incomplete for probabilistic modeling. These methods include interval analysis, fuzzy set theory, and evidence theory, which offer alternative ways to handle uncertainties in physical simulations. Such techniques are particularly useful in engineering and physics applications where the lack of information or imprecise measurements makes probabilistic approaches impractical.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Non-probabilistic UQ methods aim to quantify uncertainty in a way that does not rely on probability distributions. This is beneficial when:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Exact probability distributions are unknown: In many cases, the data available is incomplete or insufficient to derive probability distributions.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Vague or incomplete data: In some situations, especially in early design stages or under uncertain conditions (e.g., material properties, loads), only rough estimates or bounds are available.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Some key non-probabilistic methods include:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Interval Analysis: This method involves representing uncertain parameters as intervals rather than precise values or probability distributions. The output of the simulation is computed over these intervals, resulting in a range of possible outcomes.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Fuzzy Set Theory: Fuzzy logic allows for the modeling of uncertainty in systems where inputs are imprecise or vague. Each input is represented as a fuzzy set with degrees of membership, rather than a precise value.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Evidence Theory (Dempster-Shafer Theory): This approach allows for reasoning under uncertainty when there is evidence supporting different hypotheses. It generalizes Bayesian reasoning but does not require precise prior probabilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These methods provide flexibility in handling uncertainty when probabilities are unavailable or difficult to compute.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The key advantage of non-probabilistic methods is their ability to handle uncertainty without requiring precise statistical data. This is particularly important in fields such as structural engineering, where the exact loads and material properties may not be known, or in systems where data is highly incomplete.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For example, in interval analysis, uncertain parameters are modeled as ranges (intervals), and the simulation is run over the entire range of possible values. This yields upper and lower bounds for the output, providing a clear understanding of the potential variability without needing precise probabilities.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In fuzzy set theory, variables are described by fuzzy sets that allow for partial membership. For instance, in modeling uncertain material properties, the stiffness of a material might be described by a fuzzy set, where the property can partially belong to multiple categories (e.g., "soft," "medium," or "stiff").
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In evidence theory, we deal with uncertainty in the form of belief functions that distribute belief across different hypotheses. This is useful in situations where we have multiple sources of incomplete or imprecise evidence and need to combine them into a coherent model of uncertainty.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s implement interval analysis and fuzzy logic in Rust, focusing on a structural engineering example where we analyze the robustness of a structure under uncertain loading conditions.
</p>

#### **Example:** Interval Analysis for Structural Loading
{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use ndarray::Array1;

// Define a simple structural model where the stress is a function of load and cross-sectional area
fn structural_stress(load: f64, area: f64) -> f64 {
    load / area
}

// Interval analysis for load and area
fn interval_analysis(load_interval: (f64, f64), area_interval: (f64, f64)) -> (f64, f64) {
    let min_stress = structural_stress(load_interval.0, area_interval.1); // Min load / Max area
    let max_stress = structural_stress(load_interval.1, area_interval.0); // Max load / Min area
    (min_stress, max_stress)
}

fn main() {
    // Define the uncertain load and area as intervals
    let load_interval = (1000.0, 1200.0); // Load in Newtons
    let area_interval = (0.05, 0.1);      // Cross-sectional area in square meters

    // Perform interval analysis
    let (min_stress, max_stress) = interval_analysis(load_interval, area_interval);

    println!("Stress range: {:.2} - {:.2} Pascals", min_stress, max_stress);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we use interval analysis to determine the range of possible stresses a structure might experience under uncertain loading conditions and cross-sectional area. The inputs (load and area) are modeled as intervals, and the stress is computed over the entire range of these inputs, yielding a range of possible stress values. This is a simple yet powerful approach to quantify uncertainty without requiring probability distributions.
</p>

#### **Example:** Fuzzy Logic for Structural Safety Assessment
{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::cmp::Ordering;

// Define a fuzzy membership function for load (e.g., fuzzy sets for low, medium, high loads)
fn fuzzy_load(load: f64) -> (f64, f64, f64) {
    let low = if load <= 500.0 {
        1.0
    } else if load > 500.0 && load < 1000.0 {
        1.0 - (load - 500.0) / 500.0
    } else {
        0.0
    };

    let medium = if load >= 500.0 && load <= 1500.0 {
        if load <= 1000.0 {
            (load - 500.0) / 500.0
        } else {
            1.0 - (load - 1000.0) / 500.0
        }
    } else {
        0.0
    };

    let high = if load >= 1000.0 {
        (load - 1000.0) / 500.0
    } else {
        0.0
    };

    (low, medium, high)
}

// Fuzzy inference to assess structural safety
fn fuzzy_inference(load: f64, area: f64) -> f64 {
    let (low_load, medium_load, high_load) = fuzzy_load(load);

    // Rule base: If load is low, then stress is low; if load is high, then stress is high, etc.
    let low_stress = structural_stress(load, area) * low_load;
    let medium_stress = structural_stress(load, area) * medium_load;
    let high_stress = structural_stress(load, area) * high_load;

    // Aggregate the results (defuzzification by weighted average)
    (low_stress + medium_stress + high_stress) / (low_load + medium_load + high_load)
}

fn main() {
    let load = 800.0; // Load in Newtons
    let area = 0.08;  // Cross-sectional area in square meters

    // Perform fuzzy inference for structural safety
    let safety_stress = fuzzy_inference(load, area);

    println!("Estimated stress based on fuzzy logic: {:.2} Pascals", safety_stress);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we use fuzzy logic to assess the stress on a structure given an uncertain load. The load is modeled using fuzzy sets that represent "low," "medium," and "high" categories, each with a degree of membership. The structural stress is computed for each category, and the final result is obtained using defuzzification, where the different membership values are combined into a single crisp output.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Non-probabilistic methods for UQ, such as interval analysis and fuzzy logic, provide valuable alternatives for quantifying uncertainty when probability distributions are unavailable or imprecise. These methods allow us to handle uncertainty in systems where data is incomplete, vague, or imprecise. By applying interval analysis, we can compute a range of possible outcomes, while fuzzy set theory provides a way to deal with imprecise input values through membership functions. These techniques, implemented in Rust, offer powerful tools for UQ in structural analysis, engineering, and other physics applications where non-probabilistic methods are appropriate.

# 59.4. Sensitivity Analysis in Uncertainty Quantification
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Section 59.4, we explore sensitivity analysis as an essential tool in Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to measure how variations in input parameters influence the outcomes of simulations. Sensitivity analysis helps identify which parameters have the greatest impact on model outputs, allowing scientists and engineers to focus their efforts on reducing uncertainties in these key areas. By analyzing the sensitivity of different inputs, we can make simulations more efficient and robust, even under uncertain conditions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Sensitivity analysis is a fundamental tool used to determine how variations in input parameters influence the output of a model. In the context of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), sensitivity analysis helps identify which input parameters contribute most significantly to the overall uncertainty in a model's results. By understanding this, researchers and engineers can prioritize the refinement of critical inputs and parameters to reduce uncertainty and improve the reliability of simulations. Sensitivity analysis not only helps focus efforts on the most influential factors but also enhances the efficiency of model refinement processes by guiding where improvements are most needed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
There are two primary types of sensitivity analysis: local sensitivity analysis and global sensitivity analysis. Local sensitivity analysis focuses on small variations in input parameters around a specific, nominal value. It typically involves computing the derivative of the model output with respect to each input parameter, providing insight into how sensitive the output is to slight changes in the input values. This method is particularly useful in situations where the system operates near a well-defined operating point and the goal is to understand how fine-tuning certain parameters affects the outcome. For example, in optimization problems, local sensitivity analysis can help determine which parameters need precise control to achieve the desired output. However, this method is limited in its scope as it only evaluates the sensitivity of the model around a specific point, making it less suitable for understanding the broader behavior of the model across a wide range of input values.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In contrast, global sensitivity analysis examines how variations in input parameters across their entire range influence the modelâ€™s output. This approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between inputs and outputs, especially in complex models with multiple uncertain parameters. Techniques such as Sobol indices or variance-based methods are commonly used in global sensitivity analysis. Sobol indices, for instance, quantify the contribution of each input parameter to the overall variance of the model output, distinguishing between first-order effects (the direct influence of individual inputs) and higher-order effects (the interactions between multiple inputs). By decomposing the total variance into these components, global sensitivity analysis reveals not only which inputs have the greatest impact on the modelâ€™s uncertainty but also how combinations of inputs interact to influence the results. This broader view is particularly valuable in systems with a large number of inputs or complex interactions, such as climate models or engineering simulations, where many factors may contribute to uncertainty.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Conceptually, local sensitivity analysis is more focused and typically examines the gradient of the output with respect to the inputs. It is well-suited to scenarios where the system is operating near a specific configuration and where small adjustments to the inputs are expected to have measurable effects on the output. In optimization tasks or parameter tuning, local sensitivity analysis provides precise feedback on how small perturbations affect the system's performance. By contrast, global sensitivity analysis explores the input space more broadly, evaluating how uncertainties across the full range of possible input values propagate through the model. Global methods like Sobol indices are particularly useful for identifying the overall importance of different inputs, helping to reveal not only the direct contributions of individual parameters but also the complex interactions between multiple parameters.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The value of sensitivity analysis, whether local or global, lies in its ability to pinpoint the key drivers of uncertainty in a model. In systems where many uncertain parameters may influence the outputâ€”such as in climate models, engineering designs, or financial forecastsâ€”sensitivity analysis helps prioritize the most critical inputs. By focusing efforts on refining these key parameters, researchers and engineers can reduce the overall uncertainty in the model and improve its predictive accuracy. This is especially important in complex systems where many interacting variables contribute to the outcome, and understanding which inputs dominate the uncertainty can significantly enhance the robustness and reliability of predictions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s implement local sensitivity analysis and global sensitivity analysis in Rust. We will use a simple weather prediction model to demonstrate how these techniques can be applied to identify key drivers of uncertainty in weather forecasts.
</p>

#### **Example:** Local Sensitivity Analysis in Weather Prediction
{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use ndarray::Array1;

// Define a simple weather prediction model (e.g., temperature as a function of humidity and pressure)
fn weather_model(humidity: f64, pressure: f64) -> f64 {
    0.6 * humidity + 0.4 * pressure // Simplified linear model for temperature prediction
}

// Compute the local sensitivity of the output to the input parameters (derivatives)
fn local_sensitivity(humidity: f64, pressure: f64, delta: f64) -> (f64, f64) {
    let base_output = weather_model(humidity, pressure);

    // Sensitivity with respect to humidity
    let humidity_sensitivity = (weather_model(humidity + delta, pressure) - base_output) / delta;

    // Sensitivity with respect to pressure
    let pressure_sensitivity = (weather_model(humidity, pressure + delta) - base_output) / delta;

    (humidity_sensitivity, pressure_sensitivity)
}

fn main() {
    // Nominal values for humidity and pressure
    let humidity = 70.0;  // Percentage
    let pressure = 1000.0; // hPa

    // Small perturbation for local sensitivity analysis
    let delta = 1.0;

    // Compute local sensitivities
    let (humidity_sensitivity, pressure_sensitivity) = local_sensitivity(humidity, pressure, delta);

    println!("Local sensitivity with respect to humidity: {:.4}", humidity_sensitivity);
    println!("Local sensitivity with respect to pressure: {:.4}", pressure_sensitivity);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we compute the local sensitivity of a simplified weather model (where temperature depends on humidity and pressure). By slightly perturbing the humidity and pressure values, we estimate the sensitivity of the temperature prediction to these inputs. The resulting partial derivatives provide insight into which input has the most significant impact on the output.
</p>

#### **Example:** Global Sensitivity Analysis using Sobol Indices
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Global sensitivity analysis provides a more comprehensive understanding of how input parameters affect the modelâ€™s output. Letâ€™s implement Sobol indices to measure the contribution of each input to the output variance.

}

// Generate random samples for global sensitivity analysis
fn generate_samples(num_samples: usize, mean_humidity: f64, mean_pressure: f64, std_dev: f64) -> Vec<(f64, f64)> {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    let humidity_dist = Normal::new(mean_humidity, std_dev).unwrap();
    let pressure_dist = Normal::new(mean_pressure, std_dev).unwrap();

    (0..num_samples)
        .map(|_| {
            let humidity_sample = humidity_dist.sample(&mut rng);
            let pressure_sample = pressure_dist.sample(&mut rng);
            (humidity_sample, pressure_sample)
        })
        .collect()
}

// Compute Sobol indices (simplified version for demonstration)
fn sobol_indices(samples: &[(f64, f64)], mean_output: f64) -> (f64, f64) {
    let num_samples = samples.len() as f64;
    
    // Variance of total output
    let total_variance: f64 = samples.iter()
        .map(|(humidity, pressure)| {
            let output = weather_model(*humidity, *pressure);
            (output - mean_output).powi(2)
        })
        .sum::<f64>() / num_samples;

    // First-order effect of humidity
    let humidity_variance: f64 = samples.iter()
        .map(|(humidity, _)| {
            let output = weather_model(*humidity, mean_output / 0.4); // Fix pressure to mean
            (output - mean_output).powi(2)

        })
        .sum::<f64>() / num_samples;

    // Return Sobol indices (normalized variance contributions)
    (humidity_variance / total_variance, pressure_variance / total_variance)
}

fn main() {
    // Generate random samples for humidity and pressure
    let num_samples = 1000;
    let mean_humidity = 70.0;
    let mean_pressure = 1000.0;
    let std_dev = 10.0;

{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we perform global sensitivity analysis using Sobol indices. By generating random samples for the input parameters (humidity and pressure), we compute the contribution of each input to the total output variance. The Sobol indices quantify how much of the uncertainty in the temperature prediction can be attributed to variations in humidity and pressure, helping us identify the most important sources of uncertainty.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Sensitivity analysis is a crucial component of Uncertainty Quantification, allowing us to measure how sensitive a modelâ€™s outputs are to its inputs. Local sensitivity analysis provides insights into how small perturbations in input parameters affect the output, while global sensitivity analysis, such as Sobol indices, evaluates the contribution of each input to the overall variance in the output. These methods are valuable tools in complex simulations, such as weather prediction and engineering design optimization, where understanding the key drivers of uncertainty is essential. Through practical examples implemented in Rust, we demonstrate how to apply these techniques to real-world problems, highlighting the flexibility and power of sensitivity analysis in computational physics.

# 59.5. Surrogate Models for Efficient Uncertainty Quantification
<p style="text-align: justify;">
We will continue to introduce surrogate modeling as an efficient strategy to perform Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in complex simulations. Surrogate models, also known as metamodels, are simplified versions of high-fidelity models designed to approximate the behavior of a complex system with significantly reduced computational cost. Surrogate modeling allows us to conduct UQ efficiently, especially when direct simulation is computationally expensive or time-consuming.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Surrogate models serve as approximations of high-fidelity simulations. They capture the essential behavior of a complex model but are much faster to evaluate. Surrogate models are used in scenarios where running the full simulation for UQ is prohibitive, such as in fluid dynamics, material science, or weather forecasting. By constructing a surrogate model, we can quickly estimate the output for various input configurations and propagate uncertainties through the model.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Common types of surrogate models include:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE): PCE represents the uncertain system as a polynomial series, where each term corresponds to a different combination of input parameters. This method is particularly useful when the system can be well-approximated by a polynomial.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Gaussian Processes (GP): GP is a non-parametric approach that models the system as a distribution over functions. It provides not only predictions but also uncertainty estimates for each prediction, making it highly suitable for UQ.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Neural Networks (NN): Neural networks can act as surrogates by learning the underlying mapping between input parameters and outputs. Once trained, they provide fast approximations of the system, even for complex, nonlinear relationships.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Surrogate modeling is beneficial in cases where the computational cost of running high-fidelity simulations is high. By building a surrogate model, we approximate the relationship between inputs and outputs with fewer simulations. Surrogates can be used to efficiently explore the input space, optimize designs, or propagate uncertainties.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE) involve constructing a series of orthogonal polynomials to represent the output as a function of the uncertain inputs. This method is especially effective when the system behaves smoothly and can be captured by polynomials.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Gaussian Processes (GP) offer both predictions and uncertainty estimates. GP uses a covariance function to define how outputs are related based on the distance between input points, making it highly flexible for approximating nonlinear systems with uncertainty.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Neural Networks (NN), particularly deep neural networks, have the capacity to model highly complex systems. Once trained, they act as fast approximators for UQ by mapping uncertain inputs to outputs. Neural networks excel when dealing with large, high-dimensional datasets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s implement a surrogate model using Gaussian Processes for predicting the behavior of a material under varying loads. The surrogate model will approximate the high-fidelity simulation of material stress-strain behavior, and weâ€™ll use it to perform efficient UQ.
</p>

    (-diff.dot(&diff) / (2.0 * length_scale.powi(2))).exp()
}

// Build the kernel matrix for the training data

    let n = train_data.nrows();
    let mut kernel_matrix = Array2::<f64>::zeros((n, n));
    for i in 0..n {
        for j in 0..n {
            let x1 = train_data.row(i);
            let x2 = train_data.row(j);

    let kernel_matrix = build_kernel_matrix(train_data, length_scale);
    let inverse_kernel = kernel_matrix.inv().unwrap(); // Inverting the kernel matrix

    let mut predictions = Array1::<f64>::zeros(test_data.nrows());
    for (i, test_point) in test_data.outer_iter().enumerate() {

        predictions[i] = prediction;
    }
    predictions
}

    // Simulate some training data (stress as a function of load)
    let num_train_points = 10;
    let load_values = Array1::linspace(0.0, 100.0, num_train_points);
    let stress_values = load_values.mapv(|load| 2.0 * load + 10.0 + rand::thread_rng().gen_range(-2.0..2.0)); // Add some noise

    // Prepare training data
    let train_data = load_values.clone().into_shape((num_train_points, 1)).unwrap();
    let train_outputs = stress_values.clone();

    // Simulate test points for prediction
    let num_test_points = 20;
    let test_load_values = Array1::linspace(0.0, 100.0, num_test_points);
    let test_data = test_load_values.clone().into_shape((num_test_points, 1)).unwrap();

    // Predict using the Gaussian Process surrogate model
    let length_scale = 10.0;
    let predicted_stress = gp_predict(&train_data, &train_outputs, &test_data, length_scale);

    // Display the predictions
    for (load, prediction) in test_load_values.iter().zip(predicted_stress.iter()) {
        println!("Load: {:.2} N, Predicted Stress: {:.2} Pa", load, prediction);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we implement a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model to predict material behavior (stress as a function of load). The GP model is trained on a small number of high-fidelity simulations (stress values at different loads), and once trained, it can make fast predictions for new loads. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel is used to capture the relationship between different load values, and the GP provides both predictions and uncertainty estimates.

#### **Example:** Neural Network Surrogate Model for Material Behavior
<p style="text-align: justify;">
We can also implement a simple neural network surrogate model for approximating the behavior of the material under different loads.

    let weighted_sum = weights.dot(inputs) + biases[0];
    weighted_sum.max(0.0) // ReLU activation
}

fn main() {
    // Simulate some training data (stress as a function of load)
    let num_train_points = 10;
    let load_values = Array1::linspace(0.0, 100.0, num_train_points);
    let stress_values = load_values.mapv(|load| 2.0 * load + 10.0 + rand::thread_rng().gen_range(-2.0..2.0)); // Add some noise

    // Initialize weights and biases for a single-layer neural network
    let weights = Array1::random(1, Normal::new(0.0, 1.0).unwrap());
    let biases = Array1::random(1, Normal::new(0.0, 1.0).unwrap());

    // Perform predictions using the neural network surrogate model
    for load in load_values.iter() {

        println!("Load: {:.2} N, Predicted Stress: {:.2} Pa", load, predicted_stress);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we implement a simple neural network with one layer to act as a surrogate model for predicting material stress under different loads. Neural networks can approximate complex systems by learning the relationships between inputs and outputs, providing a fast alternative to running the full simulation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Surrogate models are a powerful tool for performing efficient UQ in complex simulations, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy. Techniques like Gaussian Processes (GP), Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE), and Neural Networks (NN) allow us to approximate high-fidelity models and quickly generate predictions across the input space. These methods are essential in fields like material science, weather forecasting, and optimization, where running full-scale simulations is computationally prohibitive. Rustâ€™s performance and ability to handle large datasets make it an ideal platform for implementing surrogate models and conducting efficient UQ in computational physics.

# 59.6. Uncertainty Quantification in Multiphysics Simulations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, we delve into Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in multiphysics simulations, where multiple interacting physical phenomena are modeled simultaneously. Multiphysics simulations are increasingly important in computational physics because many real-world problems involve the coupling of different physical domains. Examples include fluid-structure interactions, climate models, and aeroelasticity, where fluid dynamics and structural mechanics interact, or atmospheric and oceanic dynamics are simulated together. Performing UQ in these systems is complex due to the need for consistency across the coupled models and the propagation of uncertainty through different physical domains.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Multiphysics simulations involve modeling multiple physical processes that interact with one another. For example, in fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems, the behavior of a structure is influenced by the surrounding fluid, and vice versa. These systems are coupled and require the simulation of fluid dynamics and solid mechanics simultaneously. Uncertainty Quantification in multiphysics simulations is crucial for assessing how uncertainties in one domain (e.g., fluid properties) affect the behavior in another domain (e.g., structural response).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in multiphysics systems presents several key challenges due to the complexity of interactions between different physical domains. One of the major challenges is the propagation of uncertainties across domains. In multiphysics simulations, uncertainties in one physical domain, such as fluid properties, can propagate into another domain, like structural behavior. This cross-domain propagation can compound uncertainties and create complex dependencies between the models. For instance, if the fluid properties are uncertain, such as viscosity or pressure, these uncertainties will affect the stress distribution in a solid structure that interacts with the fluid. This interaction makes it difficult to isolate the impact of uncertainties in one domain from their effects in another, leading to a more complex system where uncertainties are interdependent and difficult to trace.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another significant challenge is the computational cost associated with UQ in multiphysics systems. These simulations are computationally expensive because they involve solving coupled equations from different physical domains simultaneously. For example, in fluid-structure interaction models, the fluid dynamics and structural mechanics must be computed together to capture the interaction between the two domains accurately. This coupling of domains increases the computational burden significantly, especially when uncertainty quantification methods like Monte Carlo simulations or Bayesian inference are applied. These methods typically require running multiple simulations to estimate uncertainties, which, when applied to multiphysics models, can lead to prohibitively high computational costs. Therefore, optimizing performance through techniques like parallel computing or reduced-order models is often necessary to make UQ feasible in these systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Maintaining model consistency across different domains is another crucial challenge in UQ for multiphysics systems. The models representing different physical phenomena must remain synchronized, especially in terms of boundary conditions and data transfer between them. For example, in fluid-structure interaction simulations, the fluid's pressure and velocity at the interface with the structure must be consistent with the structureâ€™s displacement and forces. Any mismatch in the data transfer between the two models can lead to inaccurate results or instability in the simulation. Ensuring consistency across models is not only critical for accurate simulation results but also for effectively managing uncertainty, as any inconsistencies could amplify uncertainties or introduce errors that were not present in the individual domain models.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Conceptually, uncertainty propagation in multiphysics systems occurs in two main ways. Direct propagation refers to when uncertainties in one domain directly influence the outcomes in another. For instance, if there is uncertainty in the fluidâ€™s viscosity, this will directly impact the structural behavior by altering the forces exerted on the structure. On the other hand, coupled propagation involves interactions between uncertainties in both domains, where the effects of uncertainty in one domain are influenced by the state of the other domain. An example of this can be found in climate models, where uncertainties in ocean temperatures affect atmospheric models, and the uncertainties in atmospheric conditions in turn influence ocean models. Handling these propagations requires advanced probabilistic methods such as Monte Carlo simulations or Bayesian inference, but their application in multiphysics systems demands careful coordination to account for the dependencies between domains.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We will now explore how to handle UQ in a multiphysics system using Rust. For this example, letâ€™s focus on fluid-structure interaction (FSI), where we simulate the interaction between fluid flow and a flexible structure. We will propagate uncertainty in the fluid domain (e.g., uncertain fluid properties) and evaluate its impact on the structural response.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we simulate fluid-structure interaction (FSI) using a simplified model where fluid pressure, determined by fluid velocity and density, interacts with the structure. We use Monte Carlo simulation to propagate uncertainties in the fluid domain (uncertain velocity and density) and examine how these uncertainties affect the structural response. This approach allows us to quantify the mean structural response and the uncertainty (standard deviation) in the response.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In multiphysics simulations, one of the challenges is maintaining consistency between the coupled models (fluid and structure in this case). For example, the structural deformation may influence the fluid flow, and the fluid pressure may affect the structural response. Synchronizing the data exchange between the fluid and structure models is crucial for accurate simulation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A common strategy is to use staggered coupling:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">First, solve the fluid dynamics for a given structural state.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Then, solve the structural response based on the fluid pressure.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Iterate this process until convergence (i.e., when the fluid and structure results are consistent with each other).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Uncertainty Quantification in multiphysics simulations presents unique challenges due to the coupling between different physical domains and the complex interactions that can arise. By propagating uncertainties through the system, we can assess how uncertainties in one domain (e.g., fluid flow) affect the behavior in another domain (e.g., structural deformation). Monte Carlo simulations are a powerful tool for UQ in multiphysics systems, but they require careful management of data consistency across the models. Rustâ€™s performance and concurrency features make it well-suited for handling these computational challenges, enabling efficient UQ in large-scale, coupled simulations such as fluid-structure interactions and climate models.

# 59.7. Bayesian Approaches to Uncertainty Quantification
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this section, we explore Bayesian approaches to Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), which are widely used to incorporate both prior knowledge and observational data in a systematic framework. Bayesian methods allow us to update uncertainties iteratively as new data becomes available, providing a flexible and rigorous approach to model calibration and uncertainty estimation. This section focuses on Bayesian inference, posterior distributions, and Bayesian model averaging, demonstrating how these methods are applied in UQ for computational physics.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification involves updating the uncertainty about model parameters using Bayesâ€™ theorem. The key components of Bayesian UQ are:

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Prior distribution: This represents the initial belief or uncertainty about a parameter before observing any data. It encapsulates any prior knowledge about the system.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Likelihood function: This quantifies how likely the observed data is, given a particular set of model parameters.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Posterior distribution: The posterior distribution is the updated belief about the parameter after incorporating the data. It combines the prior distribution and the likelihood function.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Bayesian model averaging: In cases where multiple models are plausible, Bayesian model averaging combines predictions from different models, weighted by their posterior probabilities, providing a more comprehensive uncertainty estimate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Bayesian approach is particularly useful in model calibration, where uncertain parameters are adjusted based on observed data, and in uncertainty propagation, where we aim to quantify how uncertainties in the input parameters affect the modelâ€™s output.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Bayesian inference is grounded in Bayes' theorem:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$
P(\theta | D) = \frac{P(D | \theta) P(\theta)}{P(D)}
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
where $P(\theta | D)$ is the posterior distribution (the updated belief about the parameter $\theta$ given the data $D$), $P(D | \theta)$ is the likelihood (the probability of observing the data given the parameter), $P(\theta)$ is the prior distribution, and $P(D)$ is the evidence (a normalization constant that ensures the posterior is a valid probability distribution).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is used when multiple models are being considered. Instead of choosing a single best model, BMA incorporates predictions from several models, weighted by their respective posterior probabilities. This reduces overconfidence and better captures model uncertainty, especially in complex systems like quantum simulations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The main challenge in Bayesian UQ is that the posterior distribution is often complex and cannot be computed analytically. To address this, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to sample from the posterior distribution.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s implement Bayesian inference using MCMC in Rust, focusing on a quantum simulation where we calibrate an uncertain parameter in a model. Weâ€™ll use MCMC to sample from the posterior distribution and estimate both the parameter and its uncertainty.
</p>

#### **Example:** Bayesian Inference in Quantum Simulations using MCMC
{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rand::Rng;
use rand_distr::{Normal, Distribution};

// Define a simple quantum simulation model (e.g., energy as a function of a parameter)
fn quantum_model(param: f64) -> f64 {
    param.powi(2) + 2.0 * param + 1.0 // Example: simple quadratic function
}

// Likelihood function: P(data | param)
fn likelihood(data: f64, param: f64, noise: f64) -> f64 {
    let normal = Normal::new(quantum_model(param), noise).unwrap();
    normal.pdf(data)
}

// Perform Metropolis-Hastings MCMC to sample from the posterior distribution
fn metropolis_hastings(data: f64, prior_mean: f64, prior_std: f64, noise: f64, num_samples: usize) -> Vec<f64> {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    let mut samples = Vec::new();
    
    // Initial guess for the parameter
    let mut current_param = prior_mean;

    for _ in 0..num_samples {
        // Propose a new parameter
        let proposal = current_param + rng.gen_range(-prior_std..prior_std);

        // Compute acceptance probability (ratio of posterior probabilities)
        let current_likelihood = likelihood(data, current_param, noise);
        let proposed_likelihood = likelihood(data, proposal, noise);

        let acceptance_ratio = proposed_likelihood / current_likelihood;

        // Accept or reject the new sample
        if acceptance_ratio > rng.gen::<f64>() {
            current_param = proposal;
        }

        samples.push(current_param);
    }

    samples
}

// Compute posterior mean and uncertainty (standard deviation)
fn compute_posterior_statistics(samples: &[f64]) -> (f64, f64) {
    let mean: f64 = samples.iter().sum::<f64>() / samples.len() as f64;
    let variance: f64 = samples.iter().map(|&x| (x - mean).powi(2)).sum::<f64>() / samples.len() as f64;
    (mean, variance.sqrt()) // Return mean and standard deviation
}

fn main() {
    // Simulated observation data (e.g., energy measurement)
    let observed_data = 10.0;  // Observed energy value
    let noise = 1.0;           // Measurement noise

    // Prior information about the parameter
    let prior_mean = 2.0;  // Mean of the prior distribution
    let prior_std = 1.0;   // Standard deviation of the prior distribution

    // Perform MCMC to sample from the posterior distribution
    let num_samples = 10000;
    let samples = metropolis_hastings(observed_data, prior_mean, prior_std, noise, num_samples);

    // Compute posterior mean and uncertainty
    let (posterior_mean, posterior_std) = compute_posterior_statistics(&samples);

    println!("Posterior mean of the parameter: {:.4}", posterior_mean);
    println!("Posterior uncertainty (standard deviation): {:.4}", posterior_std);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we implement Bayesian inference for a simple quantum simulation, where the energy of a system is modeled as a quadratic function of an unknown parameter. Using MCMC (specifically, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm), we sample from the posterior distribution of the parameter, given noisy observed data. The posterior samples are used to compute the posterior mean and uncertainty (standard deviation), providing an updated estimate of the parameter based on the observed data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This approach can be extended to more complex systems, such as quantum state estimation, where Bayesian methods help calibrate model parameters and quantify uncertainty in quantum systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In some cases, there may be multiple competing models that describe the system. Instead of selecting a single model, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) allows us to combine predictions from several models, weighted by their posterior probabilities. This reduces overconfidence in any single model and improves the robustness of the uncertainty estimates.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The process of BMA involves:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Compute the posterior probability for each model based on the observed data.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Average the predictions from all models, weighted by their posterior probabilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
BMA is particularly useful in situations where the model structure is uncertain or where there are multiple hypotheses to test.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Bayesian approaches to Uncertainty Quantification provide a flexible framework for incorporating prior knowledge and observational data into model calibration and uncertainty estimation. Through Bayesian inference, we can update our beliefs about model parameters and propagate uncertainties through the system. Using tools like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we can sample from complex posterior distributions and compute meaningful statistics, such as the posterior mean and uncertainty. In cases where multiple models are plausible, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) offers a systematic way to combine model predictions and account for model uncertainty. Rustâ€™s performance and efficiency make it a powerful platform for implementing Bayesian methods in computational physics simulations.

# 59.8. Validation and Verification in Uncertainty Quantification
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this section, we explore the critical concepts of Validation and Verification (V&V) in the context of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). V&V ensures that simulations faithfully represent real-world physics (validation) and that numerical methods are implemented correctly (verification). These steps are essential for establishing confidence in the simulation results, improving the accuracy of UQ methods, and ensuring that the models produce reliable predictions when applied to real-world scenarios.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Verification in the context of simulations focuses on ensuring that the mathematical models and numerical methods used in a system are implemented correctly. It is primarily concerned with the internal consistency of the simulation, checking whether the code produces accurate results based on known solutions and whether the numerical algorithms are functioning as expected. For example, if a simulation involves solving differential equations, verification involves ensuring that these equations are discretized correctly and that the numerical methods solve them accurately. This process ensures that the implementation adheres to the prescribed numerical algorithms, and any bugs or errors in the code are identified and corrected. The ultimate goal of verification is to confirm that the simulation behaves as it should for problems where the solutions are already well understood.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Validation, on the other hand, is concerned with how well the simulation reflects real-world physical phenomena. While verification ensures that the simulation is solving the mathematical model correctly, validation checks whether the mathematical model itself is appropriate for the physical problem at hand. This typically involves comparing the simulation results to experimental data or observations from the real world. If the model can accurately reproduce these real-world behaviors, it is considered validated. Validation is critical in building confidence that the simulation is useful for predicting unknown outcomes. It helps establish that the assumptions underlying the model are appropriate for the specific problem being solved, ensuring that the simulation is not just mathematically correct but also physically meaningful.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the context of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), both verification and validation (V&V) play crucial roles. First, verification ensures that any uncertainties inherent in the simulationâ€”whether they arise from numerical errors, discretization, or algorithm choicesâ€”are correctly handled within the model. Ensuring that the code accurately propagates uncertainties through the system is key to producing reliable results. Validation, on the other hand, helps establish confidence that the quantified uncertainties are not just artifacts of the simulation but reflect real-world variability. By comparing simulation results to actual data, validation ensures that the uncertainties predicted by the model are grounded in physical reality. This is essential for applications where predictions based on uncertain inputs are used for decision-making or risk assessment. Together, V&V provide a foundation for improving model accuracy, ensuring that the simulation both behaves correctly and represents the real world appropriately.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Verification can be broken down into several key techniques. Code verification involves checking that the numerical algorithms are implemented correctly. One common approach is to use benchmark tests, where the model is applied to problems with known analytical solutions. If the simulation produces accurate results for these well-understood problems, it provides confidence that the numerical algorithms are correctly implemented. Another important aspect is solution verification, which assesses the accuracy of the numerical solution produced by the model. This often involves examining the convergence behavior of the solution as the mesh is refined or the time step is reduced. For example, in a fluid dynamics simulation, refining the mesh should result in more accurate predictions, and monitoring how quickly the solution converges can indicate whether the numerical error is within acceptable bounds. Solution verification ensures that the model is not just solving the equations but doing so with sufficient precision to be useful in practice.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Validation typically involves comparing the simulation outputs with experimental data. The key is to determine whether the model can accurately predict physical phenomena. Discrepancies between simulation results and experimental data can help identify model deficiencies, guide model refinement, and provide insights into the uncertainty of the model.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
V&V in UQ ensures that the uncertainty estimates produced by the simulation are both mathematically sound and physically meaningful. By systematically comparing the model's predictions to real-world data, validation establishes confidence in the model's ability to make reliable predictions under uncertainty.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We will now implement Verification and Validation (V&V) techniques in Rust, focusing on two examples: a structural simulation and a thermal modeling problem. First, we verify the numerical methods used in the simulation, and then we validate the simulation results by comparing them to experimental data.
</p>

#### **Example:** Verification and Validation in Structural Simulation
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Letâ€™s start by implementing a simple structural model and performing solution verification by checking the convergence behavior.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use ndarray::Array1;

// Define a simple structural model: displacement as a function of applied force and stiffness
fn structural_model(force: f64, stiffness: f64) -> f64 {
    force / stiffness // Hooke's law: displacement = force / stiffness
}

// Perform solution verification by refining the force step size and examining convergence
fn verify_convergence(stiffness: f64) {
    let force_values: Vec<f64> = (1..=10).map(|i| i as f64 * 10.0).collect();
    let mut displacements = Array1::<f64>::zeros(force_values.len());

    // Compute displacements for each applied force
    for (i, &force) in force_values.iter().enumerate() {
        displacements[i] = structural_model(force, stiffness);
    }

    // Output the displacements
    println!("Displacements for increasing forces:");
    for (force, displacement) in force_values.iter().zip(displacements.iter()) {
        println!("Force: {:.2} N, Displacement: {:.4} m", force, displacement);
    }

    // Check convergence behavior (for example, halving the force step size and comparing)
    let refined_force_values: Vec<f64> = (1..=20).map(|i| i as f64 * 5.0).collect();
    let mut refined_displacements = Array1::<f64>::zeros(refined_force_values.len());

    for (i, &force) in refined_force_values.iter().enumerate() {
        refined_displacements[i] = structural_model(force, stiffness);
    }

    println!("\nDisplacements with refined force step size:");
    for (force, displacement) in refined_force_values.iter().zip(refined_displacements.iter()) {
        println!("Force: {:.2} N, Displacement: {:.4} m", force, displacement);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let stiffness = 100.0; // Stiffness in N/m

    // Perform solution verification by checking convergence with different force steps
    verify_convergence(stiffness);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we simulate the displacement of a structure under increasing force using Hookeâ€™s law. We perform solution verification by checking the convergence behavior of the numerical solution. By refining the force step size, we ensure that the solution converges as expected, verifying that the numerical method is correctly implemented.
</p>

#### **Example:** Validation in Thermal Modeling
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Next, we validate a simple thermal model by comparing the simulation results with experimental data. Suppose we have experimental data for the temperature distribution in a material heated on one side, and we aim to validate the simulation model against this data.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rand::Rng;

// Define a simple thermal model: temperature as a function of distance from the heat source
fn thermal_model(distance: f64, thermal_conductivity: f64) -> f64 {
    thermal_conductivity / (1.0 + distance.powi(2)) // Simplified model: temperature decreases with distance
}

// Compare simulation results to experimental data for validation
fn validate_against_experiment(experimental_data: &[(f64, f64)], thermal_conductivity: f64) {
    println!("Comparing simulation results to experimental data:");

    for &(distance, experimental_temp) in experimental_data.iter() {
        let simulated_temp = thermal_model(distance, thermal_conductivity);
        println!(
            "Distance: {:.2} m, Simulated Temp: {:.2} Â°C, Experimental Temp: {:.2} Â°C",
            distance, simulated_temp, experimental_temp
        );
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Simulated experimental data (distance from heat source in meters, temperature in Celsius)
    let experimental_data = vec![
        (0.0, 100.0),
        (0.5, 60.0),
        (1.0, 30.0),
        (1.5, 20.0),
        (2.0, 15.0),
    ];

    // Simulate the thermal model with a given thermal conductivity
    let thermal_conductivity = 80.0; // Example value for thermal conductivity

    // Validate the thermal model by comparing it to experimental data
    validate_against_experiment(&experimental_data, thermal_conductivity);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we use a simple thermal model where the temperature decreases with distance from a heat source. We then compare the simulated temperature distribution to experimental data. This process of comparing the model's predictions to real-world measurements ensures that the simulation accurately reflects the physics of the system, thereby validating the model.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Validation and Verification (V&V) are essential components of the simulation process, ensuring that numerical methods are implemented correctly and that the models accurately reflect physical reality. Verification checks the correctness of the numerical algorithms and the consistency of the solution, while validation compares the simulation results to experimental data, establishing confidence in the model's predictive capabilities. In the context of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), V&V ensures that the uncertainties are propagated correctly and that the predictions made under uncertainty are reliable. Rust's capabilities in numerical computation and performance make it an excellent platform for implementing V&V in complex simulations.
</p>

# 59.9. Case Studies and Applications
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this last section, we present case studies and real-world applications of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in physics and engineering, emphasizing how UQ enhances simulation reliability, robustness, and decision-making. By applying UQ techniques to fields such as nuclear safety, climate prediction, and aerospace engineering, we showcase how uncertainties in model parameters, environmental conditions, and operational factors can be systematically analyzed, leading to better-informed risk assessments and reliable outcomes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
UQ applications are essential in critical fields where uncertainties in simulations can have significant consequences. In nuclear safety, for example, uncertainties in material properties, operating conditions, and environmental factors can affect reactor performance. Understanding these uncertainties helps ensure that safety margins are adequate, even under the most extreme conditions. Similarly, climate predictions rely on UQ to account for uncertainties in atmospheric and oceanic models, leading to more robust forecasts. In aerospace engineering, UQ is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of designs under uncertain operational conditions, such as fluctuating temperatures, pressures, and material properties.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The primary objective of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in various scientific and engineering fields is to understand and quantify how uncertainties in model inputs affect the outputs. By systematically examining how these uncertainties propagate through models, UQ provides insights into the reliability and accuracy of predictions. In practical terms, this means determining how factors like material properties, environmental conditions, or operational variablesâ€”each of which may carry inherent uncertaintiesâ€”affect the overall performance or outcome of a system. UQ allows researchers and engineers to assess risks, particularly by analyzing worst-case scenarios, where uncertain inputs combine in ways that could lead to system failures or undesirable outcomes. Ultimately, the goal is to improve the robustness of designs and predictions, ensuring that they remain reliable across a broad range of conditions, even when uncertainties are present.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In nuclear safety, UQ plays a critical role in ensuring the reliability and safety of reactor designs. In these systems, uncertainties can arise from various factors, such as material degradation over time, variability in heat transfer coefficients, or operating conditions that deviate from expected norms. These uncertainties can impact the structural integrity and performance of nuclear reactors, and failing to account for them could result in catastrophic consequences. UQ is often implemented through techniques like Monte Carlo simulations, where random samples of uncertain input variables are used to simulate a range of potential outcomes, and Bayesian inference, which updates uncertainty estimates as more data becomes available. By incorporating these uncertainties into the safety analysis, engineers can better evaluate safety margins, ensuring that reactors will operate reliably even in the face of unpredictable conditions. This process is critical for validating safety protocols and mitigating risks in nuclear engineering.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In climate prediction, uncertainties are particularly complex, stemming from uncertain initial conditions, incomplete knowledge of climate system dynamics, and variability in the parameter values used in climate models. These uncertainties can have a significant impact on long-term forecasts, such as predictions of global temperature increases, shifts in weather patterns, or changes in sea levels. UQ methods like ensemble simulationsâ€”which run multiple versions of a climate model with different initial conditions or parameter setsâ€”and global sensitivity analysis are employed to quantify how these uncertainties influence predictions. By analyzing the spread of outcomes from different simulations, researchers can better understand the range of possible futures and provide more informed forecasts. This is crucial for policymakers and stakeholders who need to make decisions based on uncertain predictions about the long-term behavior of the Earth's climate.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In aerospace engineering, UQ is vital for ensuring the reliability and safety of structural components and systems subjected to uncertain conditions, such as fluctuating loads, thermal stresses, or variable material properties. In this domain, the consequences of uncertainty can be severe, given the high demands on performance and safety in aerospace systems. Probabilistic methods, such as polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) and Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), are commonly used to propagate uncertainties through models and quantify the associated risks. PCE allows engineers to represent the influence of uncertain parameters in a mathematical framework, making it easier to assess the impact of these uncertainties on system performance. LHS, on the other hand, is a statistical method that efficiently samples uncertain input parameters to generate a more comprehensive understanding of how variations in inputs affect the outputs. By employing these methods, aerospace engineers can design systems that are robust to uncertainties, ensuring that aircraft and spacecraft perform reliably under a wide range of operational conditions. This is especially important when dealing with extreme environments or mission-critical components where failure is not an option.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We will now focus on practical implementations of UQ in Rust, applying these techniques to specific case studies. Letâ€™s start with an example in nuclear safety, where we assess the uncertainty in reactor performance due to uncertain thermal conductivity and fuel degradation over time.
</p>

#### **Example:** UQ in Nuclear Safety using Monte Carlo Simulation
{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rand::Rng;
use rand_distr::{Normal, Distribution};
use ndarray::Array1;

// Define a simplified model of reactor performance as a function of thermal conductivity and degradation
fn reactor_performance(thermal_conductivity: f64, degradation: f64) -> f64 {
    // Example model: performance decreases with lower thermal conductivity and higher degradation
    thermal_conductivity / (1.0 + degradation)
}

// Monte Carlo simulation for UQ in reactor performance
fn monte_carlo_uq(thermal_mean: f64, thermal_std: f64, degradation_mean: f64, degradation_std: f64, num_samples: usize) -> Vec<f64> {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    let thermal_dist = Normal::new(thermal_mean, thermal_std).unwrap();
    let degradation_dist = Normal::new(degradation_mean, degradation_std).unwrap();

    (0..num_samples)
        .map(|_| {
            let thermal_sample = thermal_dist.sample(&mut rng);
            let degradation_sample = degradation_dist.sample(&mut rng);
            reactor_performance(thermal_sample, degradation_sample)
        })
        .collect()
}

// Compute the mean and standard deviation of the performance results
fn compute_statistics(samples: &[f64]) -> (f64, f64) {
    let mean: f64 = samples.iter().sum::<f64>() / samples.len() as f64;
    let variance: f64 = samples.iter().map(|&x| (x - mean).powi(2)).sum::<f64>() / samples.len() as f64;
    (mean, variance.sqrt()) // Return mean and standard deviation
}

fn main() {
    // Define mean and standard deviation for uncertain parameters
    let thermal_mean = 50.0;  // Mean thermal conductivity in W/mK
    let thermal_std = 5.0;    // Standard deviation of thermal conductivity
    let degradation_mean = 0.1; // Mean degradation factor
    let degradation_std = 0.05; // Standard deviation of degradation

    // Number of Monte Carlo samples
    let num_samples = 10000;

    // Perform Monte Carlo UQ simulation
    let performance_samples = monte_carlo_uq(thermal_mean, thermal_std, degradation_mean, degradation_std, num_samples);

    // Compute statistics
    let (mean_performance, std_performance) = compute_statistics(&performance_samples);

    println!("Mean reactor performance: {:.4}", mean_performance);
    println!("Uncertainty (standard deviation): {:.4}", std_performance);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we simulate the performance of a nuclear reactor using a simplified model that depends on thermal conductivity and material degradation. These parameters are uncertain, and we use Monte Carlo simulation to propagate the uncertainties through the model. By running multiple simulations with different random samples of thermal conductivity and degradation, we compute the mean reactor performance and its uncertainty (standard deviation).
</p>

#### **Example:** UQ in Climate Predictions using Ensemble Simulations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For the climate prediction case study, we can implement ensemble simulations to explore how uncertainties in atmospheric and oceanic parameters affect long-term climate predictions.
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rand::Rng;
use rand_distr::{Normal, Distribution};

// Define a simplified climate model: temperature increase as a function of atmospheric and oceanic parameters
fn climate_model(atmosphere: f64, ocean: f64) -> f64 {
    0.7 * atmosphere + 0.3 * ocean // Example: simplified weighting of atmosphere and ocean contributions
}

// Ensemble simulation for UQ in climate predictions
fn ensemble_uq(atmos_mean: f64, atmos_std: f64, ocean_mean: f64, ocean_std: f64, num_ensembles: usize) -> Vec<f64> {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    let atmos_dist = Normal::new(atmos_mean, atmos_std).unwrap();
    let ocean_dist = Normal::new(ocean_mean, ocean_std).unwrap();

    (0..num_ensembles)
        .map(|_| {
            let atmosphere_sample = atmos_dist.sample(&mut rng);
            let ocean_sample = ocean_dist.sample(&mut rng);
            climate_model(atmosphere_sample, ocean_sample)
        })
        .collect()
}

// Compute the ensemble mean and uncertainty (standard deviation)
fn compute_statistics(samples: &[f64]) -> (f64, f64) {
    let mean: f64 = samples.iter().sum::<f64>() / samples.len() as f64;
    let variance: f64 = samples.iter().map(|&x| (x - mean).powi(2)).sum::<f64>() / samples.len() as f64;
    (mean, variance.sqrt())
}

fn main() {
    // Define mean and standard deviation for atmospheric and oceanic parameters
    let atmos_mean = 1.0;  // Mean atmospheric parameter
    let atmos_std = 0.2;   // Standard deviation of atmospheric parameter
    let ocean_mean = 0.8;  // Mean oceanic parameter
    let ocean_std = 0.1;   // Standard deviation of oceanic parameter

    // Number of ensemble simulations
    let num_ensembles = 5000;

    // Perform ensemble UQ simulation
    let temperature_samples = ensemble_uq(atmos_mean, atmos_std, ocean_mean, ocean_std, num_ensembles);

    // Compute statistics
    let (mean_temperature, std_temperature) = compute_statistics(&temperature_samples);

    println!("Mean predicted temperature increase: {:.4} Â°C", mean_temperature);
    println!("Uncertainty (standard deviation): {:.4} Â°C", std_temperature);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this climate prediction example, we use ensemble simulations to account for uncertainties in atmospheric and oceanic parameters. By generating random samples of these parameters and running multiple simulations, we obtain an ensemble of predicted temperature increases. This allows us to compute the mean predicted temperature increase and its uncertainty, providing a robust estimate of how uncertainties in the climate system propagate to long-term predictions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this section, we presented case studies that demonstrate the power of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in real-world applications, such as nuclear safety, climate predictions, and aerospace engineering. Through practical Rust implementations, we explored how UQ techniques like Monte Carlo simulations and ensemble modeling can be applied to quantify uncertainties in critical systems, improving the robustness and reliability of the predictions. By systematically accounting for uncertainties, UQ enables better-informed decision-making and risk assessment in complex, high-stakes scenarios.
